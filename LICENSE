This document provides detailed information about the licensing of the MegaMek project.

## License Overview

MegaMek uses a dual-licensing approach:

1. **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)** for all code
2. **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0)** for all game data and assets

## Code License Details

All source code in the MegaMek, MegaMekLab, and MekHQ repositories is licensed under GPLv3.

**What this means:**

- You can use, modify, and distribute the code

- Full license text: [LICENSE.code](LICENSE.code)

## Intellectual Property Notices

MegaMek is an unofficial, fan-created digital adaptation and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or licensed by
Microsoft Corporation, The Topps Company, Inc., or Catalyst Game Labs.

MechWarrior, BattleMech, 'Mech and AeroTech are registered trademarks of The Topps Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Catalyst Game Labs and the Catalyst Game Labs logo are trademarks of InMediaRes Productions, LLC.

## Streams & Content Creators

We know many of you share your MegaMek experiences through videos and streams, and we want to ensure you can continue
doing so without concerns.

Despite the non-commercial clause in our new CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license, **we explicitly grant permission for content
creators to monetize videos and streams featuring MegaMek gameplay. This includes ads, donations, subscriptions,
sponsorships, and platform partner programs**

The key distinction is simple: you're monetizing your creative work about MegaMek (commentary, tutorials, entertainment),
not our game data itself. A YouTube channel about MegaMek tactics with ads is perfectly fine. A website that hosts our
unit stats with ads or premium subscriptions is not allowed.

What's not permitted are monetized websites, apps, or services built primarily on MegaMek game data - things like
commercial army builders, paid reference apps, or subscription-based unit databases. These uses violate both our license
and Microsoft's Game Content Usage Rules for BattleTech content.

This permission for content monetization will be maintained in our official licensing policy. We value content creators
who help grow our community and want to protect the project's standing as a non-commercial fan work.

## Historical License Information

Prior to version 0.50.07, MegaMek and MegaMekLab were licensed under GNU General Public License v2.0 or later (GPLv2+).
MekHQ was already using GPLv3. The transition to the current licensing structure was implemented with the release of
version 0.50.07.
