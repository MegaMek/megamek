/**
 * This class implements a KeyEventDispatcher, which handles all generated 
 * KeyEvents.  If the KeyEvent correspondes to a registerd hotkey, the action 
 * for that hotkey will be used to consume the event otherwise the event will
 * be dispatched as normal.
 * 
 * The idea is that the system is split into two: keys can be bound to string
 * commands, and string commands can be bound to <code>CommandAction</code> 
 * objects, which are a simple class that implements an "actionPerformed" 
 * method.  The class that implements the <code>CommandAction</code> creates 
 * the object and registers it, agnostic to what key is bound to the command.  
 * Then, somewhere else (ie; a file) can specify what keys are bound to what 
 * string commands.  The possible string commands are specified in 
 * <code>KeyCommandBind</code>.
