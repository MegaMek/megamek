# Tables adapted from the Against the Bot Campaign Civilian Units Tables    #
#   Original tables can be found here:                                      #

#   As noted in the original files (probably), these are fan works 
#   and should not be taken as official in any way.                         #
#                                                                           #
# Adaptation performed by user Obvious from                                 #

# Notes on adaptation:                                                      #
# * The original tables use a d10 to randomly determine the type of unit.   #
#   Then additional d10s to determine specific units within the type.       #
# * Rarely, a 3rd d10 is required (heavy APCs.                              #
# * Therefore, weighting on a d900:                                         #
#       d10(type)*d10(unit)*d9(heavy apc reroll)                            #
