Since lots of people are asking, I'll provide some of the basic stuff.  Everything else you must find in TW or AT2R
(since the rules really haven't changed much and I don't have TW yet).

-Your fighter must have velocity points to move.  If it doesn't have any starting velocity, you must accelerate first on
the map.  Each thrust point you have gives you 16 hexes.

-When you click on a hex, you will see several different numbers.  The number in the very upper right corner of the hex
is your turn number.  When the turn indicator turns yellow, you can turn one hexside, but it will cost you thrust points.
When it turns green you can turn for free.  The big number in the center of the hex that looks like "(#//#)" tells you
how many hexes you have traveled out of how many hexes you must move.  The number below that one indicates the altitude
level you are flying at.

-If you have no velocity, you will stall out.  If your aircraft is an aerospace fighter, a spheroid, or is a conventional
fighter with V/STOL equipment, you have to click on the "Hover" button.

-To attack targets, you must fly over them during the movement phase.  All units which are under the flight path are
valid targets for air-to-ground attacks.

-Strike attacks are straight forward.  Just fly over an enemy unit.  In the attack phase, click on that unit to attack.

-Dive bombing is the same way.  Fly over a hex, then right click on that hex in the attack phase, and dive bomb it
(you must be equipped with bombs).  You cannot bomb and strike in the same turn.

-Level (or altitude) bombing is also possible.  Just fly over a row of hexes and drop a max of 2 bombs per hex.  The
hexes must be consecutive.

-When you're ready to fly off the map and make a go-around for another strike, simply fly the aircraft to the border hex
and click on "Fly off" (you will find it when you click "More" a couple times).  If you fly off the same turn you fly
onto the map, you will not be able to attack.  To be able to fly off the map, the "(Unofficial) Allow return flyovers"
in the Advanced Aerospace Rules tab in the game options must be selected.

-Aerospace units can now take off and land.  This may not yet work on all terrain types (landing on snow, for an example,
is not possible yet).  To use grounded aerospace units on a map, set their starting altitude to zero in the MegaMek lobby.

*NOTE:  The bot cannot use aerospace units yet.  Find a friend or play against yourself for the time being!
