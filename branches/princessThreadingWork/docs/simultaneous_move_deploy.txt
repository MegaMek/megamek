Simultaneous Movement and Deployment have been implemented at this time, with the following changes from the published rules:

1.  Stacking Violations (TO 216) are no longer resolves with a separate roll. Whichever player placed a unit in a hex first occupies the hex.
    While I would like to change this to follow canon behavior for a future release, this was a simpler way to add the feature in for the moment.
    Arlith's client feedback code will allow the choice for the separate roll initiative winner to choose which player occupies the hex.
    
2.  This also affects physical attacks as described on page 216 also, since the stacking doesn't change charge and DFA will need to be declared
    as normal for MegaMek's current implementation. However, the client feedback feature that Arlith implemented will come in handy for this as
    the code gets adjusted to handle it exactly as the rules state.
