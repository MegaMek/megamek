  
CODE IDEAS:
-----------
could almost be combined:
- boardlisteners listen to boardview, not board
-- seperate client and gui, allowing for other guis/gui-less bots, etc.

- clean up report generation in Server.java

- improve code readibility, commenting; break up 80+ character lines, etc.
- make fields private, classes encapsulated

? javax.swing gui

- the turn report could keep a list of "message" objects 
  instead of a large report string.  This would allow some customizing of the
  display, or even translation (vieleicht zum Deutcher sprache.)
- more server validation of client data

- Both Server and Compute are getting WAY overcrowded.  We need to re-factor.

- The following rules in BMRr iterrupt the resolution of a unit's movement or
  attacks to immediately allow a player to react.  We can handle this by having
  the Server spawn a new thread that sends a "special turn" packet to the
  targeted player's client, and holding the current movement processing until
  the special turn thread ends.  The targeted player would take their action,
  and the special turn thread would process the result and end.
-- avoiding skid collisions
-- revealing hidden units to make point blank shots
-- stepping out of a domino effects chain

- The megamek.common.Board needs a deserialization method that will restore
  the transient bldgByCoords from the buildings member; then remove the
  game.board.newData(game.board) call from Server#setGame().

RULES/DISPLAY STUFF TO DO, OR AT LEAST TO CONSIDER:
---------------------------------------------------
general:
- double reports when firing phase happens and physical phase is skipped
- in the lobby, perhaps the mech name could be hidden and only show the BV
- in Mech Selection dialog, implement an "advanced filters and sorts" pane

board display:
? show dead mechs as rubble?
? some way to resize chat to be bigger or smaller
- nice to be able to see other mech's stats while waiting (or firing, or whatever)
- zooming and/or scrollbars
- display blown off limbs, and make available for clubs

mechs:
- allow split criticals for large weapons in MEP files (or in general)
- any more .mep parsing problems?
- parse XML files (from BTTC, even)
-- Find out how to get M$ .exe to allow UTF-8 encoding.
-- handle template XML files
-- handle "slottless" equipment
-- enforce ammo loading restrictions

initiative:
? ineligible units should maybe count in the action queue, but be skipped
- possibly stagger within packs
? might show whole initiative sequence somewhere

movement:
- remaining todos in pavement skidding
- go prone action

weapon attacks:
? option to step thru roll by roll
- eliminate leg weapons & kicks in level 1 water under level 1 rules
- warn player when weapon fire will negate a Solo Attack

physical attacks:
- dfa should violate stacking, charging should not
- opposing pushes should counter each other

displacement issues:
- domino effect: mechs with movement available can roll to step out of the way

falling:
- Examine code that controls falls to surface of water.

infantry:
- implement the following special rules:
-- VTOL movement
-- Underwater movement
-- Torpedos
-- Minefields
-- Minesweepers
- implement BattleArmor units as their special rules are implemented
        (e.g. VTOL for Sylph, Underwater movement and torpedos for Undine).

buildings:
- Test all of my assumptions.
- Where do I put the attacker when it charges or DFAs a building?!?
- Do multihex buildings absorb damage charges within the building?
- When a unit is displaced through a building, do we handle it like normal
  movement through a wall?
- Buildings need to roll for basements.
-- Roll when first unit enters.
-- Basement collapse drops floor of hex, but not surface or ceiling.
-- Building collapse drops Meks and Tanks into basement.
- Meks and Infantry can be on a non-ground building floor.
- Meks and Tanks that exceed the Building's current CF collapse building.
- Bridges can be targeted and collapse like buildings, but provide no cover.


FUTURE VERSION PLANS:
---------------------
- any remaining level 1 rules without bugs
- level 2!
- more interface improvements, particularly in the lobby
