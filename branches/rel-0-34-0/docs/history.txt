  To use this, Java 3d needs to be installed on your machine 
  (https://java3d.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html.
  Then, run MegaMek with the commandline parameter
  -Dmegamek.client.ui.AWT.boardView=megamek.client.ui.AWT.boardview3d.BoardView3D
  Also, the memory allocated to MegaMek should be increased by using the command
  line parameter -Xmx256M, as soon as you want to play on somewhat larger maps.

+ Patch 1230249, Bugs 1224113, 1224451: Arrow IV homing targets mapsheet.
   The server tries to share out homing missiles fairly among TAGs fired
   at targets on the same mapsheet. 
   TAG has a "mode" setting, allowing that TAG shot to take 1,2,3 or 4 shares
   of the incoming missiles. This allows the player some control over target
   priority (e.g. send 3 missiles at the Atlas and 1 at the Marksman).
   If there are more incoming missiles than the sum of the priorities, it
   starts over (so no need to mess with mode
   setting at all if you just want an even split).
   The "Rulebreaker" option "a4homing_target_area" uses 8 hex radius from the
   target hex instead of mapsheets for eligible targets.

+ Bug 1230607: C3 Masters should be able to TAG.
+ Bug 1042069: Allow Fusion Vehicles that have Vacuum Protection to survive in
    vacuum. To add Vacuum Protection to a unit, give it an equipment named
    "Vacuum Protection".
+ Bug 1174457: after /reset minefield's wouldn't work.
+ more cost fixing goodness.
+ Bug 1194504: Added "done" marker to right-click and pop-up window on
    BoardView1, to make it easier to determine if something has moved.
+ Allow autoeject setting in Scenario files.
+ Minor change to IEntityMovementType for future work on submarines.
+ AmmoType refactoring broke LBX ACs.
+ Code for parsing autoeject setting wasn't compatible with pre-1.5 Java
+ Bug 1224232: Now correctly penalises BV for TAG and homing rounds.
+ Created new /logs directory and moved appropriate files there.  Also
    renamed MegaMek.log to megameklog.txt for ease of use.
+ Bug 1230913: Old techbase bugfix for HMPRead not committed until now.
+ Added OfficialUnitList.txt--massaged version of an official unit list, 
    with name of each official unit, who uses it, type, date of manufacture.
    Should make for easy official unit checking/time period restriction/etc.
+ Patch 1231268: AC incendiary and tracer ammo.
+ Bug 1231362: Verification of custom TDB meks not working
+ Fixed build.xml to create the logdir if neccessary
+ Build.bat should be working again.
+ Obsolete TODO in EntityListFile.java was only valid when we created an EXE;
    produce XML files in UTF-8 format.
+ Added TODOs to handle slotless equipment and tank crits.
+ "Canon units only" option added--doesn't work 100% of the time, bunches of
    our unit names (like all infantry) are wrong, according to my master list.

+ Patch 997507: Reworked how scrolling works, including a Drag-and-Drop right-
    click scroll option, like it is used in lots of other games. The default 
    scrolling is unchanged, except that now right-click default scrolling works
    also in the firing phase, this was made possible because now we don't get 
    a 'Target Hex' context menu after scrolling with the right mouse button,
    which also made the 'always scroll using right click' option obsolete.
    Shift scrolling works the same as before, but it can't be used exclusively
    anymore. To use the new Drag-and-Drop right-click scrolling option,

    Shift-Key scrolling), and see that you can scroll by holding the right
    mouse button and moving the Mouse.

  still have one arm but are at a +1 to hit with all weapons and can not
  fire weapons in that arm.
+ Task L3 Opposed weight mods for physicals: PSR BTH when being kicked or 
  pushed is modified by weight class difference. Modifier is 1 for every 
  weight class difference. Add the difference to the PSR BTH if the attacker
  is heavier, subtract if the attacker is lighter.
