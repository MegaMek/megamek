# The format goes as follows:
# {chassis/exact} [model] [image filename] 
#
# Note that infantry does not make wrecks...
# 
# Use exact to specify the unit exactly, for example:
# exact "Marauder MAD-3R" "marauder.gif"
# exact "Timber Wolf Prime" "timberwolf.gif"
# 
# You may also just specify a graphic for a chassis, for example:
# chassis "Marauder" "marauder.gif"
#
# Images should be greyscale, 84x72 pixel gifs with the chassis centered.  The
# tinting process is subtractive, so make images light.
