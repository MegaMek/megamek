FUTURE AMMENDMENTS (game developers)
1) Incorporate Clan Enhanced Imaging neural implants into MegaMek.
2) Allow other than standard-size maps in a scenario.
3) Allow one side to use the Faction Location (with the ability to define how many hexes out from the side) while the other side uses Hex Placement.
4) Incorporate the Hex Placement option.
5) Create necessary code to allow strafing attacks.
6) Add the ability to use the /skip command on one's self so that units can be deployed in accordance with the scenario.
7) Incorporate delayed troop entry into the scenario system.
8) Add the ability to set heatscale levels the way we can set damage levels prior to the beginning of a campaign.
9) Add building placement options for scenarios.
10) Add Initiative modifiers.
11) Add To-Hit modifiers.
12) This scenario lacks the effect of hostile environment Swamps & Fog.  Whenever that is added, this scenario should be more interesting.
13) Add TOC PackRat to MegaMek's unit list.
14) Code in the rules for Tactical Operation Center/Command Console.
15) Find a way to have scenarios load saved unit list.

GENERAL RULES
Clan units play by clan honor rules.  
Once a clan unit picks an opponent, no other clan units may attack that unit. If the clan units are outnumbered, they may choose to take on more than one opponent at a time.  If there are more clanners then Strikers, the extra clanners will sit back and wait for the engaged clanners to die, unless fired upon.
Clan units must not initiate physical attacks.
Clan units do not retreat to Inner Sphere units unless otherwise stated in the scenario.

**********1st Somerset Strikers Scenario #1 - CLASH IN THE CANYON (EPISODE 2), pg. 102**********

SITUATION
Strikers find two clan mechs in a narrow canyon.

Strikers Air Support
Cadet Katiara Kylie (Gunnery 4, Piloting 3), Banshee BSE-X2

Deployment
The Striker 'Mechs set up within six hexes of the north end of the canyon.  They must have no line of sight to the Clan 'Mechs. See Special Rules about Kylie's Banshee.

DEFENDER
BlackVision

Black Vision, Falcon Star
Star Colonel Kristen Redmond (Gunnery 2, Piloting 2), Mad Dog Prime
Mechwarrior Deval (Gunnery 3, Piloting 4), Hunchback IIC HBK-IIC

Deployment
The defenders set up first.  Mad Dog goes in hex 0721 facing southwest.  Hunchback IIC goes in hex 0620 facing south.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
The Strikers win a decisive victory if they destroy both clan mechs.  They win a marginal victory if both clan mechs are either driven off or destroyed.
The Jade Falcons win a decisive victory if they destroy all of the opposing mechs.  They win a marginal victory if both their mechs escape through the North end of the canyon.

SPECIAL RULES
Recommend playing this scenario with Double-Blind option set to true (unless using bot as a player).
Units may only exit the mapsheets off the north and south edges. The Pavement hexes on the South end the South map are non-play areas.   If a mech moves into one of these hexes (intentionally or unintentionally), it is considered out of play & should eject.  Do not place any mech on the Level 10 canyon walls.
Clan mechs cannot retreat until they have line of sight with a Striker mech. They can only retreat off the north edge of the map.
The scenario starts off with the two clan mechs finishing off a fallen Centurion. The clanners must not move north nor face any of the northern hexsides until a LOS is established with the Strikers.
The Banshee strafes the clan mechs just before the beginning of Turn 1.  The Strikes player should choose one of the clan mechs and attack it with both medium lasers, hitting on a 7 or better.  As the battle progresses, the fighter may turn around and strafe the battlefield up to three more times, during the Weapon Attack Phases of Turns 2, 4, and 6.  Resolve hit location for all these strafing attacks as if they originated from directly south of the target.

MEGAMEK ADJUSTMENTS
The map setup called for in the scenario is currently impossible to setup in MegaMek.  This required a shift in all directions 90 degrees clockwise (West is now North, East is now South).
While the information for the Strikers Air Support is provided in this scenario for (wishful thinking) future applications, the current version does not support this capability.  To compensate, I have assumed that half of the total shots (2 lasers x 4 strafes = 8 hits / 2 = 4 hits) from the Banshee made there marks, and divided the damage equally among the clan mechs, using the Addition Damage option of the current scenario system.  Any effects these attacks have are legitimate, even if it kills both 'Mechs before start of game (if that ever happens, let me know).

Deployment
The Strikers set up second and may start anywhere on the east mapsheet facing and direction.  Val's Centurion does not begin play on the map.  During the Movement Phase of Turn 3, he enters play from any hex along the north or east edge of the map.  See Special Rules about Kylie's Banshee.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
The attackers win a decisive victory if they destroy or drive off all the defending 'Mechs before the FedCom troops arrive.
The defenders win a decisive victory if they destroy four or more Clan 'Mechs while losing none of their own.  They win a marginal victory if none of their 'Mechs are destroyed.  Note that Striker 'Mechs exiting the map off the east edge are not considered destroyed, but "driven off" by the Clans.

SPECIAL RULES
Set the temperature to 60 degrees Celsius in the Game Options.
The scenario is over at the end of Turn 6 when the FedCom troops land.
All Clan 'Mechs start play with 13 heat points, including the Clan 'Mechs starting on Turn 3.
The Clan forces must stay on the map.  The Strikers can only exit the east edge.
The Banshee Strafes the Clan 'Mechs just before the beginning of Turn 1.  The Strikes player should choose one of the Clan 'Mechs and attack it with both medium lasers, hitting on a 7 or better.  As the battle progresses, the fighter may turn around and strafe the battlefield up to three more times, during the Weapon Attack Phases of Turns 2, 4, and 6.  Resolve hit location for all these strafing attacks as if they originated from directly east of the target.

MEGAMEK ADJUSTMENTS
Since the scenario system cannot currently delay the deployment of units, the second star will fill hexes 0108 through 0112, face south, and wait for the first star to move out of the way and attain their place by Turn 3.  They will not fire nor be fired upon until Turn 3.  As for the Val's Centurion, he will be placed anywhere along the east or north edge, and can move prior to Turn 3 as long as he stays within the east or north edge.  He will not engage nor be engaged by the enemy until Turn 3.
Because all 'Mechs will be on the board from the beginning, this will effect the turn rotations.  Use the following sequence until round 3:
If attacker wins the initiative; 1stSomersetStrikers(Centurion), BlackVision(Alpha Talon), BlackVision(Alpha Talon), 1stSomersetStrikers, BlackVision(Alpha Talon), BlackVision(Command Star), 1stSomersetStrikers, BlackVision(Alpha Talon), BlackVision(Command Star), BlackVision(Command Star), 1stSomersetStrikers, BlackVision(Alpha Talon), BlackVision(Command Star), BlackVision(Command Star)
If defender wins the initiative; BlackVision(Alpha Talon), BlackVision(Alpha Talon), 1stSomersetStrikers(Centurion), BlackVision(Alpha Talon), BlackVision(Command Star), 1stSomersetStrikers, BlackVision(Alpha Talon), BlackVision(Command Star), BlackVision(Command Star), 1stSomersetStrikers, BlackVision(Alpha Talon), BlackVision(Command Star), BlackVision(Command Star), 1stSomersetStrikers
To reflect the fact that all Clan 'Mechs are supposed to start of with 13 heat points on their scale, the first star during the first round and the second star during the third round will not use 13 heat points worth of their heatsinks, regardless of the 'Mechs capabilities to overheat without consequence.  If the 'Mech does not have 13 heatsinks available to start with (6.5 if Double Heatsinks), the mech may not move or fire.  After that round, nothing's stopping you from cooking your 'Mech as you see fit.
While the information for the Strikers Air Support is provided in this scenario for (wishful thinking) future applications, the current version does not support this capability.  To compensate, I have assumed that half of the total shots (2 lasers x 4 strafes = 8 hits / 2 = 4 hits) from the Banshee made there marks, and divided the damage equally among the Clan 'Mechs, using the Addition Damage option of the current scenario system.  Any effects these attacks have are legitimate, even if it kills the 'Mechs before start of game (if that ever happens, let me know).

The Command Lance begins in any hexes along the south edge of the map (hex numbers ending in 34).  All of the defending 'Mechs begin the scenario facing north.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
The attackers win a decisive victory if they destroy all of the defending 'Mechs without losing any of their own.  They win a marginal victory if they destroy all defending 'Mechs.
The defenders win a decisive victory if they destroy all of the attackers.  They win a marginal victory if they destroy three or more of the attacking 'Mechs.

SPECIAL RULES
Defending units cannot retreat.  The defenders must add a +1 to-hit modifier to all attacks and subtract 2 from all Initiative rolls.
Set Game Options "MaxTech pilot advantages" to true.

MEGAMEK ADJUSTMENTS
The map setup called for in the scenario is currently impossible to setup in MegaMek.  To compensate, all directions are shifted 90 degrees clockwise (West is now North, East is now South).
The Wotan TMM have had there Gunnery Skills adjusted to reflect the +1 to-hit modifier penalty for the defending units' demoralization.
To reflect the Initiative roll penalty against the defenders, I have given the attackers the Tactical Genius Advantage. (Though I'm not sure if it is operational yet).  Activate the MaxTech pilot advantages under the options tab to use it.

Deployment
Place the Centurion in Hex 0818 facing north.  Place the Axman in Hex 0719 facing southwest.  Place the Mauler in Hex 0819 facing south.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
The attackers win a decisive victory if Kristen Redmond destroys all of the defending 'Mechs without aid from the other 'Mechs in her Star.  The attackers win a marginal victory if they destroy all of the defending 'Mechs.
The defenders win a decisive victory if all three 'Mechs escape off the south edge of the mapsheet.  They win a marginal victory if one or two mechs escape off the south edge.

SPECIAL RULES
Kristen Redmond says she alone will deal with all three Strikers.  No other mech may fire its weapons or move closer to the defenders than Kristen.  This restriction is lifted if Kristen's Mad Dog is destroyed or disabled.  The Mad Dog is considered disabled if all of its weapons, both arms, or one or both legs are destroyed; if it shuts down due to overheating; or if Kristen fails a Consciousness roll.
Valten Ryder has decided to hold off the Clanners while the others get to the Kwaidan.  He may not begin to move south until the other two Striker mechs are at least halfway to the edge (Hexrow XX27 or farther).  Kristen will only fire at the Centurion while Val maintains a defensive posture.  Kristen may fire at any of the Strikers once Val begins to retreat.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
The team with the last surviving unit left on the mapsheet wins a decisive victory.  No marginal victory.

SPECIAL RULES
Each armored trooper is deployed as a separate unit.
If the players wish to use the rules for Hostile Environments, treat all the River hexes as Clear swampy terrain (see p. 91 BattleTech Compendium; Rules of Warfare).
The entire battlefield is covered with a thick fog.  As a result, attacks against standing 'Mechs suffer a +1 to-hit modifier, while attacks against prone 'Mechs and infantry suffer a +2 to-hit modifier.  Clan EI neural implants reduce these penalties by 1.  These modifiers do not apply to a target in a hex adjacent to the attacker.

MEGAMEK ADJUSTMENTS
The map setup called for in the scenario is currently impossible to setup in MegaMek.  To compensate, all directions are shifted 90 degrees clockwise (West is now North, East is now South).
Clan Enhanced Imaging neural implants are not incorporated into MegaMek.
This scenario lacks the effect of hostile environment Swamps & Fog.  Whenever that is added, this scenario should be more interesting.

**********1st Somerset Strikers Scenario #6 - ENEMY OF MY ENEMY (EPISODE 10), pg. 107**********

Ernest (Patch) McGuire (Gunnery 7, Driving 7) Packrat Mobile Tactical Operations Center

Deployment
The Strikers set up first.  Place Adam's Axman in Hex 2006.  The other Striker 'Mechs may be set up in any Level 0 hex within two hexes of the Axman.  The Packrat (Gnat, see below) may begin play in any Level 0 hex on the east half of the map (hexes 17XX through 32XX), and need not be placed until after all Clan units have been deployed.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
Malthus's Star wins a decisive victory if all of the Strikers' mechs are destroyed without the cooperation of Redmond's Star.  They win a marginal victory if the Strikers are destroyed after the two Clan Stars join forces (see Special Rules, below).
Redmond's Star wins a decisive victory if Malthus's Star is destroyed before the two units join forces.  After that point, the two Clan Stars share a marginal victory if they destroy all the Strikers' mechs.
The Strikers must survive long enough to discover that Andrew is not present on this planet, then make good their escape (see Special Rules, below).  If all of the Striker units escape off the map after this point, the defenders win a decisive victory.  If two or more units escape, they win a marginal victory.

SPECIAL RULES
This scenario has three groups: the Strikers, Malthus's Star, and Redmond's Star.
The Strikers are trying to locate Adam's brother.  They will eventually discover that he isn't on the planet, but they must stay on the battle field until they do.  During the End Phase of each turn, the Strikers' player should use the /roll command.  If the result is equal to or less than the current turn number, the Strikers may begin to retreat.  No Striker unit may retreat until then.  They will have to exit the map from the side furthest from their slowest mobile unit.  If two sides are equal distance, roll randomly to determine the side off which the Strikers must retreat.
Redmond's Star may only attack Malthus's Star at the beginning of the scenario.  She and her troops are not concerned with the Strikers.  Eventually, Redmond agrees to join Malthus in hunting down the Strikers.  To determine when this happens, the two Clan players should use the /roll command at the End Phase of each turn, beginning with the first turn in which Redmond's Mad Dog has a line of sight to Malthus's Summoner.  If the results of these die rolls are equal, the two Stars join forces against the Strikers.

MEGAMEK ADJUSTMENTS
STRONGLY recommend playing this scenario with Double-Blind option set to true (unless using bot as a player).
Clan Enhanced Imaging neural implants are not incorporated into MegaMek.
MegaMek does not have the TOC PackRat variant, so the Gnat is used in its place for its ECM Suite & lack of weapons.  However, it moves faster than the PackRat, so do not use more than 11 Movement Points with it.  To reflect the initiative bonus of a TOC, The Gnat has a Tactical Genius pilot advantage (though whether or not it works is uncertain).

**********1st Somerset Strikers Scenario #7 - CHAOS IN THE JUNGLE (EPISODE 11), pg. 109**********

Place the four rebel mechs in the following hexes: 1407, 1410, 1507, and 1511.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
The Strikers win a decisive victory if all of their 'Mechs manage to exit the map off the west edge.  They win a marginal victory if Franklin's Hatamoto-Chi exits the west edge of the map and a combined total of five or more ISF and rebel 'Mechs are destroyed.
The ISF wins a decisive victory if they destroy the Hatamoto-Chi and all the rebel 'Mechs.  They win a marginal victory if they accomplish one or the other of these objectives.
The rebels win a decisive victory if Franklin's Hatamoto-Chi exits the west edge of the map and all the ISF 'Mechs are destroyed.  However, this is reduced to marginal if the Strikers achieve a decisive victory.

SPECIAL RULES
This should be played by three players: the Strikers, the ISF, and the rebels.
The Banshee Strafes the rebel mechs just before the beginning of Turn 1.  The Strikes player should choose any one rebel mech and attack it with both medium lasers, hitting on a 8 or better.  As the battle progresses, the fighter may turn around and strafe the battlefield up to three more times, during the Weapon Attack Phases of Turns 2, 4, and 6.  Resolve hit location for all these strafing attacks as if they originated from directly east of the target.  After her first strafing run, Kylie may choose to attack either a rebel mech or an ISF mech.

MEGAMEK ADJUSTMENTS
Recommend playing this scenario with Double-Blind option set to true (unless using bot as a player).
To reflect the initiative bonus of a Tactical Operation Center, The Awesome has a Tactical Genius pilot advantage (though whether or not it works is uncertain).
While the information for the Strikers Air Support is provided in this scenario for (wishful thinking) future applications, the current version does not support this capability.  To compensate, I have assumed that 3 out of 8 medium lasers from the Banshee made there marks, one to an ISF 'Mech and two to the rebel 'Mechs, using the Addition Damage option of the current scenario system.  Any effects these attacks have are legitimate, even if it kills the 'Mechs before start of game (if that ever happens, let me know).

Foot Infantry Platoon (Gunnery 4), Portable Lasers

Deployment
The Clan forces set up first.  The Point of Elementals begin play inside the Medium building in Hex 0806.  Place the foot infantry platoon in hex 0808.  Redmond's Star begins in any of the hexes along the north edge (0101 through 1601).

VICTORY CONDITIONS
The Strikers must destroy all of the Clan forces to retake Somerset Military Academy and proceed to the second part of the scenario (see Malthus Attacks, scenario 9).  If they fail, the Clans maintain control of Somerset.

SPECIAL RULES
The Banshee Strafes the Clan 'Mechs just before the beginning of Turn 1.  The Strikes player should choose one of the Clan 'Mechs and attack it with both medium lasers, hitting on a 7 or better.  As the battle progresses, the fighter may turn around and strafe the battlefield up to three more times, during the Weapon Attack Phases of Turns 2, 4, and 6.  Resolve hit location for all these strafing attacks as if they originated from directly south of the target.
The Strikers benefit from an ecstatic level of morale during this scenario.  Apply +1 to all to-hit, piloting, and Initiative rolls.  Note that this bonus allows the Strikers to roll a 13, making otherwise impossible shots possible.  This bonus is lost if Adam's Mech is destroyed.

MEGAMEK ADJUSTMENTS
The map setup called for in the scenario is currently impossible to setup in MegaMek.  To compensate, all directions are shifted 90 degrees counter-clockwise (West is now South, East is now North).
To reflect the morale bonus of the attackers, I have adjusted the attackers' Piloting & Gunnery Skills.  Though this bonus should be void at the loss of the Awesome, the Awesome will most likely make or break this scenario in order to proceed to the next scenario, thus it will most likely be in effect the entire game if the Strikers are to win. (A good clanner should like the challenge).
Clan Enhanced Imaging neural implants are not incorporated into MegaMek.
To reflect the initiative bonus of a Tactical Operation Center, The Awesome has a Tactical Genius pilot advantage (though whether or not it works is uncertain).
While the information for the Strikers Air Support is provided in this scenario for (wishful thinking) future applications, the current version does not support this capability.  To compensate, I have assumed that 6 out of 8 medium lasers from the Banshee made there marks, one to each Clan 'Mech, using the Addition Damage option of the current scenario system.  Any effects these attacks have are legitimate, even if it kills the 'Mechs before start of game (if that ever happens, let me know).

**********1st Somerset Strikers Scenario #9 - MALTHUS ATTACKS (EPISODE 13), pg. 111**********

SITUATION
Malthus arrives to take SMA back.

ATTACKER
FalconsClaws

Command Star
Star Colonel Nicolai Malthus (Gunnery 1, Piloting 2), Summoner M
Mechwarrior Ciro (Gunnery 4, Piloting 5), Timber Wolf Prime
Mechwarrior Ross (Gunnery 3, Piloting 4), Hunchback IIC HBK-IIC
Mechwarrior Uri (Gunnery 3, Piloting 4), Mad Dog Prime

Elemental Point 2 (Gunnery 4), Small Lasers
Elemental Point 3 (Gunnery 4), Flamer
Elemental Point 4 (Gunnery 4), Machine Gun
Elemental Point 5 (Gunnery 4), Machine Gun

Deployment
Malthus's forces enter from the South edge of the map.

DEFENDER
The defender consists of whatever forces remain from the previous scenario (see The Liberation of SMA, scenario 8).  If Kylie survived the previous battle, she will switch to a Banshee fighter for this scenario.
Between battles the Strikers are able to reload ammunition, and can arm an additional three platoons of infantry before Malthus arrives.  No other repairs are possible.

Strikers Replacements
Cadet Katiara Kylie (Gunnery 4, Piloting 3), Banshee BSE-X2
Franklin Sakamoto (Gunnery 5), Sloth Assault
Foot Infantry Platoon C1 (Gunnery 5), Portable Lasers
Foot Infantry Platoon C2 (Gunnery 5), Portable Lasers
Foot Infantry Platoon C3 (Gunnery 5), Portable Lasers

Deployment
All units begin this scenario in the same positions they occupied at the end of the previous scenario.  Place Franklin's Sloth in the position the Infiltrator occupied.  Place the three new platoons of infantry in any three Light buildings of the Strikers player's choice.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
The Strikers must destroy all of the Clan forces to take a back Somerset and win a decisive victory.
The Clan forces win a decisive victory if they destroy all of the Strikers' units.  They win a marginal victory if Adam Steiner is killed (the pilot dies, not merely destroying his 'Mech).
At any time during the battle, either player can call for a Trial of Possession for Somerset.  Both players must agree to the trial, and the winner will win the scenario.  This trial must be a single combat between Malthus and Adam; no other units from either side may interfere, and Rachel must leave Adam's 'Mech, eliminating the TOC bonuses.  If either Malthus's or Adam's 'Mech is destroyed before a trial can be called, no trial can take place and so standard victory conditions apply.

SPECIAL RULES
The Banshee Strafes the Clan 'Mechs just before the beginning of Turn 1.  The Strikes player should choose one of the Clan 'Mechs and attack it with both medium lasers, hitting on a 7 or better.  As the battle progresses, the fighter may turn around and strafe the battlefield up to three more times, during the Weapon Attack Phases of Turns 2, 4, and 6.  Resolve hit location for all these strafing attacks as if they originated from directly south of the target.
The Strikers benefit from an ecstatic level of morale during this scenario.  Apply +1 to all to-hit, piloting, and Initiative rolls.  Note that this bonus allows the Strikers to roll a 13, making otherwise impossible shots possible.  This bonus is lost if Adam's Mech is destroyed.
Malthus is bent on destroying Adam, but he thinks that Adam is piloting the Axman.  Malthus will attack only the Axman until it is destroyed or the pilot ejects.  After that, Malthus will take on the Awesome.

MEGAMEK ADJUSTMENTS
The map setup called for in the scenario is currently impossible to setup in MegaMek.  To compensate, all directions are shifted 90 degrees counter-clockwise (West is now South, East is now North).
Only the Awesome has the Piloting & Gunnery skills adjusted to reflect the morale bonus, because at this point the Awesome is either destroyed or go to declare a trail of position, which will not involve the other units.
Clan Enhanced Imaging neural implants are not incorporated into MegaMek.
The advantages of the TOC will not be used in a Trial of Possession, and cannot be used if the Awesome hasn't survived to this point, so nothing will be done to reflect the advantage of having it this round.
While the information for the Strikers Air Support is provided in this scenario for (wishful thinking) future applications, the current version does not support this capability.  To compensate, I have assumed that 5 out of 8 medium lasers from the Banshee made there marks, one to each Clan mech, using the Addition Damage option of the current scenario system.  Any effects these attacks have are legitimate, even if it kills the mechs before start of game (if that ever happens, let me know).
