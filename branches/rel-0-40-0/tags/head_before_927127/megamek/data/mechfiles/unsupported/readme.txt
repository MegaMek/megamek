Directories named "unsupported" (and all their sub-directories) are
ignored when MegaMek loads units on startup.

This makes them a good place for official units that have technology
that is not yet supported by MegaMek.  You probably don't want to
place units that are "mostly supported" in here though.  For example:
the Firemoth B mech has A-pods (which are not yet supported),
but MegaMek will load all the other equipment for that mech just fine.
