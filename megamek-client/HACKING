ATTENTION TO FREE/LIBRE/OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE HACKERS

This project started on a Windows system and as such, it has a few quirks that
you may find disconcerting.  The first is a complete lack of a Makefile; the
primary means of building this project is Apache Ant.  Also, there is an EXE
(which calls a BAT file) to run the game on a Windows system; the corresponding
shell script is called "startup.sh").  The release file is a ZIP file, and it
does not place everything into a directory with a version number; many files
are deposited directly into the directory that you unzip into.  As is typical
in a Windows-centric Java app, all third party libraries (i.e. JAR files) are
supplied by the project itself.  Finally, MegaMek is very particular about the
contents of the directory in which it runs; the startup.sh script attempt to
solve this problem, but let me know if it doesn't work in your setup.

Someday, I intend to address every single issue listed above.  For now,
however, please accept the limitations and move on.

MegaMek can be run on any Java v1.5 runtime, but we've gotten some
problem reports from specific OS/JVM combinations.

While there is no Makefile, it's very easy to build MegaMek with Jikes.  My
computer is running Debian Sarge with GCC installed.  Therefore, I can build
MegaMek with the following command; please modify the command to meet your
environment (email me if you have any problems).

jikes-gij -q -d classes -classpath classes -extdirs lib -sourcepath src `find src -name '*.java'`

Once MegaMek is built, I can run it with GIJ with the following command.

gij --classpath lib/Ostermiller.jar:lib/PngEncoder.jar:lib/TabPanel.jar:lib/TinyXML.jar:lib/collections.jar:l10n:classes megamek.MegaMek -log | tee MegaMek.log

I can run it under Kaffe with a similar command.

kaffe -classpath lib/Ostermiller.jar:lib/PngEncoder.jar:lib/TabPanel.jar:lib/TinyXML.jar:lib/collections.jar:l10n:classes megamek.MegaMek -log | tee MegaMek.log

The following runtime flags are available:
        -testdice : Test the random number generator used by MegaMek, and exit.
        -dedicated [gamefile.sav] : Run MegaMek as a headless server; if the
                optional SAV file is supplied, that saved game will be loaded.
        -log [filename] : If no filename is given, run MegaMek without a log
                file.  If a file is named, write the log to that file.  If this
                flag is omitted, output is automatically sent to MegaMek.log.
        -testxml filename : Parse the named XML file, display its contents, and
                then exit.
        -gui swing : Start the swing GUI
        -eqdb filename : creates a list of all valid Equipment names for MTF
                files and saves it to the specified file
        -validate unitname : tests if the specified unit is a valid design
        		E.g. to test the Stalker STK-4N, use -validate "Stalker STK-4N"

TODO list:
 * The Splash Screen that is displayed first when MegaMek starts contains an
        image.  This image should always be shown, but it flickers in and out
        of view under certain FLOSS Java runtimes.
 * The Splash Screen has a column of buttons to the right of the image.  Under
        certain FLOSS runtimes, this column has a strange width, and it has a
        stranger resize behavior.
 * The Map Editor (launched from the button with the same name) has a strange
        layout in the runtimes that have trouble laying out the Splash Screen.
 * The Map Editor has image display problems in the runtimes that have problems
        showing the image on the Splash Screen.
 * The default random number generator that MegaMek uses is an instance of the
        java.security.SecureRandom class.  Under certain runtimes, this RNG is
        very poorly implemented, as evidenced by the "-testdice" flag.
