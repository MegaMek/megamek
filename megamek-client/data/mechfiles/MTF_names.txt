See equipment.txt in the MegaMek/docs folder for equipment names that
MegaMek will recognize on custom-made units.  Note that while the
equipment may be read by MegaMek, it may not function by the rules
in any of the Battletech rulebooks.  In most cases this will not
prevent the unit from being used in a game.
