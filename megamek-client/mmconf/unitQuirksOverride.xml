This file allows users to customize the default cannon quirks list.  Any quirk assignments in this file will override
  the cannon quirk entries entirely.  Changes to this file will not take effect until the next time megamek is launched.

To assign a unit a quirk, the entry should be in the following format:
    <unit>
        <chassis>[chassis name]</chassis>
        <model>{model}</model>
        <quirk>[quirk1 name]</quirk>
        <quirk>[quirk2 name]</quirk>
        <weaponQuirk>
            <weaponQuirkName>[weapon quirk 1 name]</weaponQuirkName>
            <location>[location of weapon]</location>
            <slot>[critical slot of weapon]</slot>
            <weaponName>[name of weapon]</weaponName>
        </weaponQuirk>
        <weaponQuirk>
            <weaponQuirkName>[weapon quirk 2 name]</weaponQuirkName>
            <location>[location of weapon]</location>
            <slot>[critical slot of weapon]</slot>
            <weaponName>[name of weapon]</weaponName>
        </weaponQuirk>
    </unit>

The "model" field can be left blank if there is no model number for the unit (common for some tank chassis), but the
  tags should still be included.  A <model> of "all" will cause all units with the same <chassis> to have the defined
  quirks.  This can later be overridden with entries for specific models.

Multiple quirks should be contained within separate "quirk" tags.

Multiple weapon quirks should be contained within separate "weaponQuirk" structures, even if multiple quirks apply to
  the same weapon.

The proper names for quirks can be found in the
  l10n/megamek/common/options/messages.properties file.  Search for the "QuirksInfo" section.
  The name you want will fall between "option" and "displayableName".  For example, if you wish to apply the
  "Anti-Aircraft Targeting" quirk to a unit, you will find the following entry in the messages.properties file:
    QuirksInfo.option.anti_air.displayableName
  The name you want to include in this file for the <quirk> entry is "anti_air".

If you wish to remove all quirks for a unit, you can create an entry in this file with a <quirk> of "none".

Example:  If you wish to declare that all Atlas variants do not have the Command Mech quirk:
    <unit>
        <chassis>Atlas</chassis>
        <model>all</model>
        <quirk>none</quirk>
    </unit>

Example: If you decide only the AS7-D Atlas, but no other variant, should have the Command Mech quirk:
    <unit>
        <chassis>Atlas</chassis>
        <model>all</model>
        <quirk>none</quirk>
    </unit>
    <unit>
        <chassis>Atlas</chassis>
        <model>AS7-D</model>
        <quirk>command_mech</quirk>
    </unit>

Example: You can also do this in the opposite direction, so that all Atlases have the Command Mech quirk except the AS7-D:
    <unit>
        <chassis>Atlas</chassis>
        <model>all</model>
        <quirk>command_mech</quirk>
    </unit>
    <unit>
        <chassis>Atlas</chassis>
        <model>AS7-D</model>
        <quirk>none</quirk>
    </unit>

Example: You can define quirks that affect all units of a given chassis and then add specific quirks to specific models:
    <unit>
        <chassis>Atlas</chassis>
        <model>all</model>
        <quirk>command_mech</quirk>
    </unit>
    <unit>
        <chassis>Atlas</chassis>
        <model>AS7-D</model>
        <quirk>anti_air</quirk>
    </unit>
