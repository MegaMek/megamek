ATTENTION TO FREE/LIBRE/OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE HACKERS

This project started on a Windows system and as such, it has a few quirks that
you may find disconcerting.  The first is a complete lack of a Makefile; the
primary means of building this project is Apache Ant.  Also, there is a BAT
file to run the game on a Windows system; there is no corresponding shell
script.  The release file is a ZIP file, and it does not place everything into
a directory with a version number; many files are deposited directly into the
directory that you unzip into.  As is typical in a Windows-centric Java app,
all third party libraries (i.e. JAR files) are supplied by the project iteslf.
Finally, MegaMek has to be run in the main directory; even though the data
files could be shared between multiple users and are unlikely to change from
release to release, each installation must have its own copy of the files.

Someday, I intend to address every single issue listed above; for now, however,
one must simply accept the limitations and move on.

MegaMek can be run on any Java v1.1 runtime.  We've kept compatible with this
old version of the runtime in order to support players who want to use the
Microsoft JRE on their machines.  There *have* been a number of features added
to MegaMek that are available if a more recent version of Java is installed.
That means that MegaMek can not be *compiled* by a v1.1 JDK.  Still, I haven't
found a "modern" Java compiler that won't build MegaMek.  Please report any
problems that you run into on your environment.  One notable exception to this
rule is the file "src/megamek/client/ClientGUI.java": due to popular demand,
sounds have been added to MegaMek; sadly, the only v1.1 sound API is 
java.applet.AudioClip, which does not always work.  As a "backup", a 
Sun-specific API was used; it should be obvious that FLOSS Java environments 
will not build this file.  Please apply the patch named "gcj.patch" to correct 
this problem.

While there is no Makefile, it's very easy to build MegaMek with Jikes.  My
computer is running Debian Sarge with GCC installed.  Therefore, I can build
MegaMek with the following command; please modify the command to meet your
environment (email me if you have any problems).

jikes-gij -q -d classes --target 1.1 -classpath classes -extdirs lib -sourcepath src `find src -name '*.java' | sed -e 's/^src\///'`

Once MegaMek is built, I can run it with GIJ with the following command.

gij --classpath lib/Ostermiller.jar:lib/PngEncoder.jar:lib/TabPanel.jar:lib/TinyXML.jar:lib/collections.jar:classes megamek.MegaMek -log | tee MegaMek.log

I can run it under Kaffe with a similar command.

kaffe -classpath lib/Ostermiller.jar:lib/PngEncoder.jar:lib/TabPanel.jar:lib/TinyXML.jar:lib/collections.jar:classes megamek.MegaMek -log | tee MegaMek.log

The following runtime flags are available:
        -testdice : Test the random number generator used by MegaMek, and exit.
        -dedicated [gamefile.sav] : Run MegaMek as a headless server; if the
                optional SAV file is supplied, that saved game will be loaded.
        -log [filename] : If no filename is given, run MegaMek without a log
                file.  If a file is named, write the log to that file.  If this
                flag is omitted, output is automatically sent to MegaMek.log.
        -testxml filename : Parse the named XML file, display its contents, and
                then exit.

TODO list:
 * The Splash Screen that is displayed first when MegaMek starts contains an
        image.  This image should always be shown, but it flickers in and out
        of view under certain FLOSS Java runtimes.
 * The Splash Screen has a column of buttons to the right of the image.  Under
        certain FLOSS runtimes, this column has a strange width, and it has a
        stranger resize behavior.
 * The Map Editor (launched from the button with the same name) has a strange
        layout in the runtimes that have trouble laying out the Splash Screen.
 * The Map Editor has image display problems in the runtimes that have problems
        showing the image on the Splash Screen.
 * The default random number generator that MegaMek uses is an instance of the
        java.security.SecureRandom class.  Under certain runtimes, this RNG is
        very poorly implemented, as evidenced by the "-testdice" flag.
