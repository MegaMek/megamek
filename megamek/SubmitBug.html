  <h1>How to submit a MekHQ bug</h1>
  <p>
    MekHQ has a lot of features and the developers are often so busy developing it
    that we sadly don't get enough time to play with it. That means that if you
    catch a bug, we may never fix it unless you tell us about it. Reporting bugs is a
    way that everyone can contribute to this project, so please help us out and report
    bugs when you find them.
  </p>

  <p>
    MekHQ uses both MegaMek and MegaMekLab. If you encounter a problem while playing a
    game, you should report that to the MegaMek bug tracker, rather than the MekHQ bug
    tracker. Similarly, if you encounter a bug while trying to customize a unit within
    the Mek Lab, you should report that bug to the MegaMekLab bug tracker. Here are the
    links for all three bug trackers:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/MegaMek/mekhq/issues">MekHQ Bug Tracker</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/issues">MegaMek Bug Tracker</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/MegaMek/megameklab/issues">MegaMekLab Bug
      Tracker</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To submit a new bug to the bug tracker at github.com. To assist us in finding the bug,
    you should also attach a .zip file containing the following files to this report:

    <ol>
      <li>The game save file where the bug occurred.</li>
      <li>The mekhq.log file located in the logs directory.</li>
    </ol>

    If you are reporting a MegaMek or MegaMekLab bug encountered while running from within MekHQ,
    then you should attach the mekhq log. Otherwise, attach the log for the specific program.
  </p>

  <p>Thanks for your help, and good hunting!</p>
