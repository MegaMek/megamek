# Construction Instruction – River & Coast Boards

“Welcome to your newly delivered landscape. Here at SimonLandmine Engineering, we hope that you have many hours of
relaxing by the sea (or river, your choice). Or, alternatively, several minutes of frantic activity, surrounded by
explosions, energy blasts, and the occasional roar of jump jets. However, you wish to spend your free time, I guess …”

There are two options for putting these boards together, depending on the battle that you wish to fight. You can either
create a wide river valley with additional terrain on either side, or an extensive stretch of beachfront, suitable for
an amphibious assault.

You will notice that the boards are labeled “Inland,” “Inshore” and “River+Coast.” Each of these types of board is then
available in five different versions (all handily numbered).

There are also two ‘special’ boards—“Sea” and “SeaBridge.” You only need to use these if you’d like to have a stretch
of open water off the coast.

## Option 1: Beachfront

This can be made with up to four columns, and up to five rows, but the columns need to go in the right order so that the
land slopes up from the sea. The rows can go in any order you like.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Inland   | Inshore  | Coast    | Sea      |

(If you prefer to have the sea to the west, you can obviously rotate the lot.)

Inland boards Inland-1, Inland-2, and Inland-3 are interchangeable with each other. Inshore boards Inshore-1, Inshore-2,
and Inshore-3 are interchangeable with each other. Coast boards Coast-1, Coast-2, and Coast-3 are interchangeable with
each other.

If you wish to use the small river boards (Inland-4, Inshore-4, Coast-4) they will need to go in a row together, so that
the river joins up.

| Column 1 | Column 2  | Column 3 | Column 4 |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Inland 4 | Inshore 4 | Coast 4  | Sea      |

Similarly, if you want to use the ‘bridge’ boards (Inland-5, Inshore-5, Coast-5), they need to be used together so that
the raised highway joins up. You will also need to replace the ‘Sea’ board with the ‘SeaBridge’ board, unless you wish
to use a very high pier.

| Column 1 | Column 2  | Column 3 | Column 4  |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Inland 5 | Inshore 5 | Coast 5  | SeaBridge |

If you want a narrower board, you can drop the Inland column, or the Inshore column, or both.

## Option 2: River Valley

This set can also be used to make a river valley, resulting in a board that’s six columns wide and three rows deep.

| Col. 1  | Col. 2   | Col. 3 | Col. 4  | Col. 5    | Col. 6   |
|---------|----------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Inland# | Inshore# | River# | River#* | Inshore#* | Inland#* |

* indicates a rotated board

Again, boards numbered 1 through 3 are interchangeable with other boards of the same type (Inland/Inshore/River).

If using the small river boards (#4), these will need to be grouped together.
And if you’re using the bridge, you’ll need to use the #5 boards twice – once as normal, and once rotated. (It makes
sense when you put them together, believe me!)

Enjoy!
