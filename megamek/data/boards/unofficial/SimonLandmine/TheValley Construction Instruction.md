# Construction Instruction – Valley Boards

“Welcome to your newly delivered landscape. Here at Landmine Engineering, we hope that you have many hours of pleasant
enjoyment in this peaceful valley. Or, alternatively, several minutes of frantic activity, surrounded by explosions,
energy blasts, and the occasional roar of jump jets. However you wish to spend your free time, I guess …”

These 30x15 boards fit together to make a valley one kilometre wide and several kilometres long. I was inspired by one
of the campaign scenarios in `Charles Stewart Grant’s Programmed Wargames Scenarios (Wargames Research Group, 1983)`,
which was intended to represent a force moving northwards up a valley, while the defenders had several choices of
locations to position their forces.

I modified the suggested landscapes for MegaMek, and then created quite a few more

The Northern (top) end of the valley is represented by Board ‘Valley-NorthEnd’, and the Southern end by Boards
‘Valley-SouthEnd1’ and ‘Valley-SouthEnd2.’

All the other boards can be added in any order, to make the valley experience as long or as short as you like.
(Unfortunately, because of a quirk of design, they can’t be rotated before dropping them in.) You don’t need to use
either of the ‘end’ boards, if you would prefer to restrict battle in the middle of the valley ...

## Gazetteer of the valley

### Valley-NorthEnd

This board contains a small village on the edge of a lightly wooded hill, overlooking the junction where the road up the
valley splits.

### Valley-SouthEnd1 and Valley-SouthEnd2

These form the southern end of the valley, where it opens out to plains again.

### Valley-Canal

A canal runs across the valley, with a small docks area.

### Valley-Chicane

The valley narrows between two bluffs.

### Valley-Factory

A medium-sized industrial facility.

### Valley-Farms

Two small farms on the floor of the valley.

### Valley-Forest

A band of forest cuts across the valley.

### Valley-Hill

A small hill divides the valley into two, with a high wooded hill to the west.

### Valley-Hills

The valley widens, with a few low hills.

### Valley-Lakeside

The valley curves to the west, around a high hill, at the foot of which is a small hamlet next to a small wooded lake.

### Valley-Open1

Fairly open, with low hills and scattered woods.

### Valley-Open2

Fairly open, with low hills and scattered woods.

### Valley-Open3

A slight curve, a ridge, and some thickly wooded areas.

### Valley-Open4

Fairly open, with a wooded plateau to the west.

### Valley-Open5

A fairly straight, open, stretch of valley, with a thick woods to the east of the road.

### Valley-Quarry

A flooded quarry against the west wall of the valley.

### Valley-Ridge

A ridge cuts across the valley from west to east, with a small hamlet on the eastern end.

### Valley-River

At this point, the valley walls drop, and a river runs across, with a small village at one of the bridging points.

### Valley-Town

A small town sits in the middle of the valley.

### Valley-Village

Scattered housing on a shallow slope leading from the valley wall to a lake.

(With the full valley, it’s likely that fast-moving forces will find themselves clashing at a variety of locations,
while the heavier units slowly trudge onwards behind. Taking out those reconnaissance elements may allow forces to set
ambushes.)

Enjoy!
