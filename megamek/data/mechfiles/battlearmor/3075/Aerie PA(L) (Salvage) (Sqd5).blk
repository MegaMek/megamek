<overview>
With their expansion into the Deep Periphery in the 3060s, Clan Snow Raven designed a new battle armor for space operations. 
</overview>

<history>
The Aerie is the result of the partnership between the Ravens and the Outworlds Alliance: a power armor suit that can fight in space and on the ground. It is best suited to marine actions, as it has only the barest minimum of armor. It has a respectable ground speed that enables it to move nimbly aboard a vessel, but it can also leap up to ninety meters at a time. It also features an Extended Life Support module that allows it to operate for longer periods
</history>

<capabilities>
Generally, marines arm themselves with Laser Rifles in order to avoid dealing with recoil in space. Sometimes they do use ballistic weapons, but generally with add-ons to suppress the recoil. The Aerie can engage in anti-'Mech combat, as well as travel mechanized aboard an OmniMech.
</capabilities>

<deployment>
The Aerie has no weapons on the suit, but it can use standard infantry weapons. This variant, introduced in 3069,[6] replaces the life support unit with a Salvage Arm so it can assist in salvage operations
