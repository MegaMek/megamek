<overview>
The closest thing the Demon Series of battle armor has to a standard, front-line model, the Asura is a medium-weight design.
</overview>

<history>
The Word of Blake battlesuit is named for demons of Hindu lore and is overwhelmingly fielded by Manei Domini troops whose cybernetic enhancements make them even more powerful.
</history>

<capabilities>
Compared to the Clan Elemental the Asura is not as well armored, although its 280kg of advanced armor can withstand a hit from a Clan ER Medium Laser. The Asura does not have any enhancements to a standard trooper's ground speed but carries jump jets to leap ninety meters at a time, matching the Elemental in terms of speed, and its weaponry has a longer reach. While only ever fielded in significant numbers by the Manei Domini, unconfirmed rumors from the Terran resistance movement claims that regular Militia units also used these suit, though if true these were most likely discarded testbed models reportedly prone to glitching.
</capabilities>

<deployment>
The Asura's weapon profile is similar in some ways to the Elemental, but is also enhanced. A Medium Recoilless Rifle mounted in the right arm serves as its main weapon and has greater range than the Elemental's equivalent. Similarly, a Rocket Launcher 4 does the same damage as an Elemental's missile complement, but also at greater range. The left arm's Battle Claw allows the Asura to ride OmniMechs and engage in anti-'Mech attacks
