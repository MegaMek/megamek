<overview>
The Kopis battle armor was designed by StarCorps Industries as an assault unit. 
</overview>

<capabilities>
Slow but heavily armed, the Kopis can remain on the battlefield supporting friendly units for a long time. The advanced armor used by the Kopis designers allows it to stand up to most weaponry, shrugging off anything short of a PPC or AC/10 hit. The low top speed is mitigated through the use of VTOL transportation for offensive operations, while smart commanders use the Kopis as a defense unit for cities or other tight terrain. In those restricted environments the low top speed isn't a factor.
</capabilities>

<deployment>
Developed for the liberation of Terra introduced in 3078, this variant replaces the Medium Lasers with a single Medium Pulse Laser and a Flamer. It was used to fight the Word of Blake's infantry defenders on Terra. 
</deployment>

<history>
