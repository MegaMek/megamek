<overview>
The Kopis battle armor was designed by StarCorps Industries as an assault unit. 
</overview>

<capabilities>
Slow but heavily armed, the Kopis can remain on the battlefield supporting friendly units for a long time. The advanced armor used by the Kopis designers allows it to stand up to most weaponry, shrugging off anything short of a PPC or AC/10 hit. The low top speed is mitigated through the use of VTOL transportation for offensive operations, while smart commanders use the Kopis as a defense unit for cities or other tight terrain. In those restricted environments the low top speed isn't a factor.
</capabilities>

<deployment>
Carrying nearly as much firepower as a Succession Wars-era Stinger, the Kopis is equipped with a pair of Medium Lasers. Instead of mounting heavy missile racks that provide a few salvos of firepower, the Kopis' designers used energy weapons backed up by enough power packs to ensure that the armor would be useful on the battlefield for a long time. The power packs allow the Kopis to fire the lasers thirty times before running out of power. For anti-infantry work the Kopis mounts a Heavy Battle Claw and an Anti-Personnel Weapon Mount on each arm. These claws are fearsome melee combat weapons, and the AP Weapon mounts allow the trooper to carry smaller anti-infantry weapons without using the Medium Lasers.
