<overview>
The Buraq is a Clan Medium weight Quad battle armor, which was designed by Clan Hell's Horses during the early thirty-second century.
</overview>

<history>
The horse-like Buraq was named for the mystical steed from ancient times, and like its mystical namesake, the battle armor is noted for its high ground speed. Typically, Clan Hell's Horses have used full stars consisting of different variants of the battle armor. These Buraq Stars work as a team in their appointed mission assignments. They've been utilized on the Horses' Periphery borders to help scout and pin down pirates terrorizing their worlds.
</history>

<capabilities>
The Buraq's main feature is its Myomer Booster, which enables the Armor to reach its notable high speeds. Operators of the Buraq must rely on their speed for protection, as the Armor's hull is only protected by 175 kgs worth of Standard Armor. 
</capabilities>

<deployment>
The Hunter-Killer features the short-ranged but powerful Bearhunter Superheavy Autocannon. This variant retains the Myomer Booster and searchlight of the standard model, but also comes with Improved Sensors.
