<overview>
A "solid" heavy combat suit used mostly by Mercenaries and the Federated Suns. 
</overview>

<capabilities>
The Fusilier mounted two weapon systems, a Magshot Gauss Rifle with ten rounds of ammunition in the right arm and a Light Machine Gun with fifty rounds of ammunition in the body. An Armored Glove was installed on the left arm.
</capabilities>

<deployment>
As a heavy combat suit, the Fusilier combined aspects of the Grenadier and Sea Fox, and was designed to serve as a line unit alongside other similar suits. Because it was so slow-moving, the Fusilier mounted a Jump Booster to increase its mobility.
</deployment>

<history>
General Motors began production of the Fusilier battle armor suit at their plant in Salem in the early 3120s while there was no particular demand for the suit; despite being both too heavy and too slow, the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns purchased supplies of the Fusilier for a decade before GM began producing an upgraded version, but the Fusilier would continue to remain an odd capability within AFFS units.
