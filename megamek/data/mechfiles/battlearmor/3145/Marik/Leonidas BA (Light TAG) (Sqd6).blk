<history>
Leonidas battle armor was a product of Etna Foundries and was intended to plug a capability gap in the armed forces of the Duchy of Oriente, a gap created by scarcity of the older Achileus stealth suit. After soldiers equipped with Leonidas battle armor achieved a number of successes provided a testimony to the suit's capabilities the Leonidas suit was exported widely across the Inner Sphere and to various Periphery states.
