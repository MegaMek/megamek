<overview>
The Xiphos assault battle armor was developed by Irian Technologies specifically to create an infantry suit protected against artillery attacks, one of the most commonly-used tactics for defeating battle armor. 
</overview>

<capabilities>
All Xiphos suits mount close to a ton of Reactive Armor and mount a Basic Manipulator on the right arm and a Modular Weapon Mount on each arm, although the mount on the left arm has the greater capacity.
</capabilities>

<deployment>
This configuration mounts a Heat Sensor in the right arm and a Heavy Flamer with ten rounds of ammunition in the left arm.
</deployment>

<history>
Manufactured on Irian and Washburn for the Marik-Stewart Commonwealth (prior to the capture of Washburn by Clan Wolf) the Xiphos was manufactured in three common configurations and specifically incorporated a high-powered communications system to allow battlefield commanders to keep lines of communication open even in the face of hostile electronic countermeasures.
