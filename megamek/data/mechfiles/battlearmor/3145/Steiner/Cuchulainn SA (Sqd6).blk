<overview>
Cuchulainn Support Armor was named for a hero from Irish mythology and was the product of a joint program between Clan Wolf-in-Exile and the Kell Hounds. 
</overview>

<history>
Manufactured on Arc-Royal from Arc-Royal MechWorks and WC Site 2, Cuchulainn suits entered service prior to the Blackout and fought in a number of combat operations soon after.
</history>

<capabilities>
The Cuchulainn suits, which could only move at a speed of just over 10 km/h while carrying their Detachable Weapon Pack, were created to support other battle armour units directly with firepower by engaging enemy units at a distance while lighter suits swarmed units that tried to approach the Cuchulainns. The Cuchulainns were protected by nearly half a tonne of upgraded stealth armour while they assaulted the enemy at a distance, but despite being able to ride on mechanised transport and mounting a Basic Manipulator on each arm, they were unable to launch swarm or leg attacks.
</capabilities>

<deployment>
The only ranged weapon system on a Cuchulainn suit was the ER Medium Pulse Laser mounted on the left arm in a detachable weapon pack, along with eleven rounds of ammunition. Once the ER Medium Pulse Laser had been detached the Cuchulainn's speed doubled.
