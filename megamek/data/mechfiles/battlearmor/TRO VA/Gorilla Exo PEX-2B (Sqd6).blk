<history>
The suit was created during the mid thirty-first century when Star League technology became available again. With the introduction of the Battle Armor, StarCorps used newly regained Star League technology to produce the exoskeleton. Aimed at smaller companies which wouldn't normally to be able purchase high-end Exoskeletons, StarCorps' gambit paid off. Tens of thousands of the suit have been sold across the Inner Sphere and Periphery. It has been particularly popular with the construction trades. Between 3068 and 3069, sales of the Gorilla spiked in the Arc-Royal Theater. Later investigation found that the survivors of Wolf's Dragoons were buying large numbers of the Gorilla and using them on Outreach.
