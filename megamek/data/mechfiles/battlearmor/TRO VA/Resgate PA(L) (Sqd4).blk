<history>
 Clan Cloud Cobra's Warrior Council, after seeing so many of the lower castes killed, pushed the effort for this new design. It specialized exclusively in improving rescue operations in emergency situations. However, the design was stripped to the bare minimum of technology needed for the job. There were no combat applications fitted to the suit. After equipping the suits with fire resistant armor, members of the 849th Fire Response Unit were able to save nearly every member of a crashed DropShip from an inferno. Only one member of the crew perished.
