</capabilities>

<overview>
A typical example of the conventional support aircraft available to planetary garrisons and militias across the Inner Sphere, the Free Worlds League-produced Planetlifter is able to quickly transport combat elements more cheaply than a DropShip flight.
</overview>

<deployment>
A downgrade of the Planetlifter Tactical Support Aircraft, the Planetlifter Support trades the stealth armor and advanced electronics for a larger Arrow IV magazine.
</deployment>

<history>
For this reason, Planetlifters are placed under the direct command of a planet's garrison commander, allowing for enhanced strategic mobility between battlefields. First produced in 2598 (though similar designs have in fact existed since the early 2300s), the Planetlifter is a very rugged aircraft, though it is only protected by three tons of armor. Its VSTOL capability allows the craft to operate away from established airfields, usually one of the first targets in a planetary invasion. The aircraft can take off and land from any area with at least 400 feet of open space.
