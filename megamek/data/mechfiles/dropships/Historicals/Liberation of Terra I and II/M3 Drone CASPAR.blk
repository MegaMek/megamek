<capabilities>
A credible threat to corvette and destroyer-class WarShips and capable of destroying the most thickly armored DropShip in a single salvo.
</capabilities>

<overview>
Based on the 2650 model of the Pentagon Assault DropShip, the M-3 was the first full production SDS Drone to see widespread use.
</overview>

<deployment>
The M-3 Drone required no crew as it was completely autonomous. The SDS Drone Control System had a gunnery rating of 3 and a piloting rating of 4. The station's internal automated defenses provided 14 Marine Points to fend off boarding actions.
</deployment>

<history>
First deployed in 2698, they replaced the sullied M-2 as the primary drone system of the early SDS network. The M-3 was also the first of the drones to be built new and not as retrofits of existing, crewed ship hulls. Starting in 2704, the M-3 was produced at Oâ€™Neil Shipyards and would eventually be built at a half dozen locations across the Hegemony. Being easier to produce than the massive M-5, the majority of Hegemony systems were protected by these diminutive but deadly assault ships.
