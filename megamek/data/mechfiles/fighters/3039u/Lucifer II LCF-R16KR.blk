<capabilities>
However, numerous issues with cooling, targeting, and communications systems have plagued the design, and the ejection system was removed when the frame was refitted for high-G maneuvers. However, the craft is respected for its anti-DropShip mission and the Lyran Commonwealth has invested heavily in production. When supported by other fighters to fend off enemy fighters, the Lucifer is a very effective machine.

<overview>
Considered to be well armored and fairly well armed, the Lucifer is known for its tight maneuvering and prolonged weapons fire capabilities.
</overview>

<deployment>
The LCF-R16KR Lucifer II is a major upgrade over the original LCF-R15. This variant is protected with Ferro-Aluminum armor, and saves mass with a 260 XL Engine and removal of the LRM-20. Compared with the LCF-R15, the craft adds two SRM-6s, upgrades the large lasers to ER Large Lasers, upgrades the small lasers in each wing to a single Medium Pulse Laser, and the rear-facing medium laser to a Medium Pulse Laser, but drops some armor
</deployment>

<history>
Nicknamed “The Dragger,” the LCF series was plagued with difficulties from the start. Structural problems forced a full recall just two years after production started in 2526. A year later an issue with weapon cooling required widespread modifications. Despite a host of issues, the craft has been manufactured in large numbers and now is House Steiner’s primary medium fighter.
