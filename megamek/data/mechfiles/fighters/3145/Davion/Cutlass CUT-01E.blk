<overview>
The Cutlass was intended to battle front-line Capellan Confederation Armed Forces fighters such as the Transgressor and Troika, and the Cutlass quickly found itself taking pride of placement in AFFS interceptor squadrons.
</overview>

<deployment>
In service by 3145, the CUT-01E variant is intended to be a pursuit fighter and harasser. The CUT-01E lacks the Gauss Rifle and ER Medium Lasers of the -01D, replacing them with a single Extended LRM 20 and enough ammunition for sixteen volleys
</deployment>

<history>
Manufactured for the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns by Wangker Aerospace from their plant on Axton, the Cutlass entered service at the beginning of the thirty-second century.Well equipped with advanced electronic systems, the Cutlass makes good use of its Guardian ECM Suite to close within range of the primary weapons; high acceleration and sixteen tons of Wangker Solarion Reflective Armor help protect the Cutlass after it strikes with its weapons. The Cutlass was swiftly in service in both the Capellan and Draconis Marches.
