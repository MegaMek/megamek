<capabilities>
Built as a 'Mech-buster and DropShip attack craft, the Transit isn't fast or agile, but is easy to control and has had few loss of control accidents.
</capabilities>

<overview>
A common sight in House Liao and Capellan Confederation air lances, the Transit has armor and weapons to spare.
</overview>

<deployment>
The TR-12 is a total redesign, fitted with a Rawlings Extra-Light 250 engine, saving weight for the Lasers to be upgrade to Extended Range versions. The standard autocannon is replaced with a LB 20-X AC with an additional ton of ammunition and an extra ton of armor was added on.
