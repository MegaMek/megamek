<overview>
Developed when Clan Jade Falcon warriors demanded their own super-heavy OmniFighter to compete against Clan Ghost Bear's Kirghiz, the Scytha favors speed and pod space over that venerable fighter's preference for armor.
</overview>

<deployment>
The Scytha-X was also introduced in the Jihad. It's equipped with an experimental Watchdog CEWS, as well as five Improved Heavy Large Lasers: Two in each wing and one in the nose. Though it mounts thirty double heat sinks, it also carries a Coolant Pod for emergency cooldowns.
