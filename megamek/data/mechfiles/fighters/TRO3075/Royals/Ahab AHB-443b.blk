<capabilities>
Poor acceleration and maneuverability, likened by pilots to "a moose in molasses", is compensated by fifteen and a half tons of standard armor and a staggering array of weaponry: a full squadron of Ahabs is capable of shooting down light and medium DropShips in a single pass. The design would be modified once, in 2703, to accommodate a Narc Missile Beacon.
</capabilities>

<overview>
The Ahab debuted in 2697 as the heaviest Aerospace Fighter ever produced, a devastating missile boat for the SLDF and other Great House armies.
</overview>

<deployment>
Designed and deployed exclusively for SLDF Royal commands, the AHB-443B Ahab upgrades to Ferro-Aluminum armor and Double Heat Sinks. The Large Laser is upgraded to an ER Large Laser.
</deployment>

<history>
Originally manufactured by Harvard Company, Inc., BBA would pick up production in the early 3000s when financial malfeasance brought down the company. BBA would build only a limited number of new Ahabs and spare parts, and only to ComStar, allowing the fighters in service to the other Inner Sphere powers to fall into disrepair. In 3061 the company began production of two new variants, which were sold only to the Word of Blake.
