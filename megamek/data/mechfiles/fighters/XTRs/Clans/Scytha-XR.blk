<overview>
Developed when Clan Jade Falcon warriors demanded their own super-heavy OmniFighter to compete against Clan Ghost Bear's Kirghiz, the Scytha favors speed and pod space over that venerable fighter's preference for armor.
</overview>

<deployment>
This experimental version was created by Clan Snow Raven. Apparently created in a refit facility on Quatre Belle, the Scytha-XR trades its OmniFighter status for a new fixed weapon load. The nose carries a Rotary AC/5 and Large Pulse Laser while each wing carries an Improved Heavy Large Laser. To discourage pursuit, each Scytha-XR carries a pair of ER Medium Lasers firing to the rear. This refit can hang in combat longer since it mounts twenty-six double heat sinks and is protected by more than twenty tons of Ferro-Lamellor armor.
