Overview: First developed for the SLDF, the Archer would become a mainstay of many heavy support lances. Tough and reliable, the Archer is commonly taken as a Command 'Mech by many officers, where it can contribute to battle at range while keeping their MechWarrior away from the thickest combat.

Capabilities: Twin LRM-20 racks set this 'Mech firmly in the fire-support role. Recognition of the missile's innaccuracy at short range mandated the inclusion of four medium lasers, while powerful hand actuators make the Archer a dangerous brawler during physical engagements. As such an archtypal fire-support 'Mech, the Archer pairs well with dedicated spotters for its massive missile barrages. When combined with well-trained squads of Infantry, VTOLs, or even other 'Mechs, Archers can easily disable their chosen targets without ever being in direct sight of them.

Deployment: With more than a hundred thousand built prior to the Succession Wars, the Archer can be found within the entire Sphere and Periphery. Many factories still produce the Archer, though a few have developed their own variants of the venerable design. House Steiner's variant, the -2S, put a larger emphasis on short-ranged firepower. Similar in many ways to the Crusader, this Archer would prove to be just as deadly in close quarters as it was at range.
