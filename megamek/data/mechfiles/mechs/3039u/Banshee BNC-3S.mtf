Overview: One of the oldest assault 'Mechs still in general usage, the Banshee was created to fill a close-combat role within Terran Hegemony forces. Although initially a powerful design, the steady advance of technology soon relegated the Banshee into militia or training roles. Many would survive the ensuing Succession Wars, offering lackluster but steady service up until the design was brought back to the forefront in 3026. A new Banshee variant, offered by Defiance Industries through their factories on Hesperus II, would completely change the BattleMech and its lasting reputation. The BNC-3S, by reducing the design's engine size, finally allowed the Banshee to mount an array of weaponry well-suited to its size. Nearly all future variants would use this successful adaptation of the model as their base, proving that the Banshee could be viable once more.

Capabilities: Most Succession War-era Banshees share the same oversized engine and light firepower. While still capable, the design often finds itself outperformed by similarly-massed BattleMechs, and as a result tend to be rather unpopular rides. The slower Banshee dynasty, more akin to the Awesome, Atlas, or Stalker, can singlehandedly dismantle entire lances of lighter 'Mechs. With the firepower to fight at all ranges and the heat dissipation to handle most of the weaponry, they were quickly accepted as a premier assault BattleMech.

Deployment: The original Banshee found its way throughout the entire Inner Sphere and Periphery during the Succession Wars. Fielded more by obligation than by choice, the Great Houses finally ceased usage of the BNC-3E after the devastation of the Jihad and the disarmament that followed. The Banshee -3S, designed within the Lyran Commonwealth, would rapidly supplant all other variants. The success of this hard-hitting Banshee would see most Lyran models undergo refits to this configuration, with all future Banshee's produced by the state using this variant as their base. Many other states would follow the Lyran lead and modify their Banshees to this standard as well, but never to the same extent as in House Steiner's armies.
