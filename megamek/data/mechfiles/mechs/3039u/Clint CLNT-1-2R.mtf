Overview: Not every BattleMech developed for the Star League was a  technological marvel. The Clint, for example, won its contract through the generous use of cost-cutting and a refusal by Andoran Industries to use any advanced technology on the design. Though a middling, average BattleMechs can still have its uses, the Clint is also an absolute technical nightmare. Many of the parts that are often interchangable between BattleMechs have to be custom made for the Clint. Even worse, the shoddy quality of the parts themselves often require them to be replaced at a much higher rate than normal. If technicians are able to work past these flaws, though, the Clint mounts a surprisingly advanced targeting system that has few peers.

Capabilities: The Clint mostly operates as a heavier recon 'Mech or lower-end skirmisher. In these roles it serves well, and it demands respect from common scouting designs such as the Stinger or Wasp. The Sloane 220 targeting computer means that its firepower hits more often than average, giving the Clint a higher punch than what might be thought at first sight.

Deployment: The Clint was found in every army in the Inner Sphere during the Succession Wars. No factories produced the design, but notable concentrations were found in the Federated Commonwealth and Capellan Confederation. Certain other states, such as the Free Worlds League, often used their Clints for little more than spare parts. The initial Clint prototype, the CLNT-1-2R, carried a larger Armstrong Buster autocannon for greater punch. The weapon caused more stress issues for a chassis already known for causing technical headaches, and no Successor States fielded any beyond the Federated Suns and Capellan Confederation. Due to its many problems, no -1-2R's were kept in service after the rediscovery of the Helm Memory Core and the subsequent Clan Invasion.
