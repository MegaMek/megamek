Overview: Not every BattleMech developed for the Star League was a  technological marvel. The Clint, for example, won its contract through the generous use of cost-cutting and a refusal by Andoran Industries to use any advanced technology on the design. Though a middling, average BattleMechs can still have its uses, the Clint is also an absolute technical nightmare. Many of the parts that are often interchangable between BattleMechs have to be custom made for the Clint. Even worse, the shoddy quality of the parts themselves often require them to be replaced at a much higher rate than normal. If technicians are able to work past these flaws, though, the Clint mounts a surprisingly advanced targeting system that has few peers.

Capabilities: The Clint mostly operates as a heavier recon 'Mech or lower-end skirmisher. In these roles it serves well, and it demands respect from common scouting designs such as the Stinger or Wasp. The Sloane 220 targeting computer means that its firepower hits more often than average, giving the Clint a higher punch than what might be thought at first sight.

Deployment: The Clint was found in every army in the Inner Sphere during the Succession Wars. No factories produced the design, but notable concentrations were found in the Federated Commonwealth and Capellan Confederation. Certain other states, such as the Free Worlds League, often used their Clints for little more than spare parts. A modification made by the two major users of the design, the -2-4T sacrificed manueverability and short-ranged firepower in order to increase the number of autocannons it carried. Commonly used against VTOLs, tanks, and other conventional forces, it posed little threat against 'Mechs able to catch up to it. Just like the base Clint, no -2-4T's remained in the armies of House Davion of Liao (or any other Houses) by the end of the Jihad.
