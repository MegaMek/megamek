Overview:Looking to compete against the popular Wasp and Stinger designs, Coventry Metal Works (then known as Coventry Defense Conglomerate) designed and began producing the Commando, a slightly heavier scout that could easily handle any other reconnaissance units it may encounter or disrupt an ambush with its firepower. The Lyran Commonwealth was impressed and commissioned the Commando into service in 2486 for its exclusive use, employing whatever bureaucratic and diplomatic tools were needed to keep the design out of foreign powers’ hands. The current Commando is much different than the original. The original was built around a large laser mounted in its right arm instead of the current missile rack, but the poorly cooled laser would break down the lubricants used in the ’Mech’s wrist and hand, leading to an obscenely high actuator replacement rate, sometimes after every test
battle. Though the original model was officially replaced by the COM-2D, MechWarriors have periodically attempted to recreate it to personally judge the effectiveness of the initial prototype

Capabilities:A short-range brawler, the Commando mounts a fear some punch for its size that can rock the largest assault ’Mech. This firepower is achieved with pair of short-range missile packs with a total of ten tubes. Backed by an arm mounted medium laser, this armament was frightening
when it was introduced and remains a substantial threat, particularly to other light ’Mechs. However, each launcher had only a single ton of ammunition and was unable to draw from the other’s bin. In an extended battle, a Commando would often be left with just its medium laser
after a few minutes of battle.
Other minor flaws have been recognized over the Commando’s centuries of service. Its four tons of armor only equal that of lighter ’Mechs. Though the protection matters little against other scouts, this can be a fatal flaw against a heavier opponent. Its lack of jump jets exacerbates the
vulnerability, as in heavy terrain the Commando may have trouble escaping a large ’Mech. MechWarriors must be mindful that the Commando’s firepower is not accompanied by equally heavy protection.

Deployment:The Commando was a popular scout among Lyran forces even though it lacked the jump capability of other successful designs. Lyrans also found them useful in pairs as they could pin down enemy scouts of heavier weight and use their devastating firepower to shred foes’ armor.
Against the Draconis Combine’s Panther, however, the heavier machine’s superior weapons range and jump capability proved to be a good foil against these Commando hunter-killer groups.
The Lyrans are methodical in their deployment of the COM-3A variant, too. Though perennially popular with those units specializing in ambushes and hunting other light units, the COM-3A’s very limited ammunition left it handicapped in all but the quickest skirmishes. [EDITOR’S NOTE: After the War of 3039, some Commandos were retrofitted back to their original configuration in anticipation of the then-revolutionary “freezer” heat sinks preventing the associated actuator failures.]
