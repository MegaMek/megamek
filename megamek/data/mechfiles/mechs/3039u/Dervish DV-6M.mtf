Overview: One of the few workhorses of the Succession Wars not first designed for the SLDF, the Dervish has served with distinction in all of the armies of the Great Houses for centuries. Not a flashy design, it primarily acts as a fire-support 'Mech in many formations, but its generous secondary weaponry let it stand on its own if needed.

Capabilities: A combination of LRMs, SRMs, and lasers make each Dervish self-sufficient and able to fill multiple roles. The missile racks are well-protected and reliable, and each SRM pod is able to draw upon its own ton of ammo. The jump jets give another layer of depth to the Dervish, allowing it to reposition with the flow of the battle or flank a mispositioned enemy. The Dervish does suffer from weaker armor than many designs of its weight. In addition, the lack of hand actuators hampers it in raiding operations. Many MechWarriors are able to overlook these flaws, prefering the generalist nature of the design over other similar models such as the Shadow Hawk.

Deployment: While primarily a House Davion BattleMech, the Dervish was widely available to every power of note at the onset of the Succession Wars. Attrition would take its toll, however, and the number of the design found outside of Federated Suns borders would dwindle. House Davion would shift some production to the Lyran Commonwealth at the onset of their alliance, keeping the quantity of Dervishes in those two states high even today.
