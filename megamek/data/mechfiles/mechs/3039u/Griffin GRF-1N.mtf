Overview: The Griffin has flitted through multiple roles throughout its long and illustious existence. Originally developed to fill a middle ground between lumbing assaults and fragile light 'Mechs, the Griffin at its inception was popular, effective, and dangerous. The steady march of time and technology would eventually make the Griffin's performance less exceptional, generally pushing it into mobile fire-support roles. In this, though, it still offers sterling service, and it remains one of the most-produced medium BattleMechs in the Inner Sphere.

Capabilities: The powerful PPC of most Griffins give it a reliable punch. Secondary missile launchers, often generously fed with ammunition, give it steady follow up damage. When combined with its mobile nature and average armor, the Griffin is hard to pin down and dangerous to take likely. If the Griffin has a flaw, it is that its cooling system is inadequate for its firepower, forcing many pilots to choose between staying mobile and badly overheating.

Deployment: The Griffin, with its many manufacturing plants, can be found in all corners of human space. As its standard role keeps it out of most of the worst fighting, attrition is lower than with some designs. Even the many recent conflicts-be it the Clan Invasion, FedCom Civil War, or Jihad-have done little to reduce Griffin numbers.
