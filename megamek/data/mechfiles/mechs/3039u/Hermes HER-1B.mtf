Overview: The Star League showing it's sheer industrial and economic might commissioned yet another dedicated scout in 2632 named the Hermes.  Irian BattleMechs Unlimited was able to fulfill initial orders quicker then anticipated.  This caused concern in the Quartermaster Command despite the mech meeting the SLDF requirements.  These suspicions were confirmed as many of the initial run mechs had unresolved issues with their electronics that made the targeting system all but useless.  While the problem was eventually discovered and rectified the time needed by technicians was not insignificant.

Emphasizing mobility over firepower the Hermes actually exceeeded the ground speed of any mech in service at the time of it's introduction.  While this edge would not last forever it still gave the Hermes a 19 year initial run before lines were shutdown due to pilots being unable to adjust to a 30 ton scout and limited firepower making the mech unpopular with it's pilots.

The Succession Wars brought the Hermes back into service and Irian re-activated the production lines, even going so far as to produce a re-engineered version that gained 10 tons and was dubbed the Hermes II.

Capabilities: Once the glitch with the original Alexis Photon Target Acquisition System was sorted out the system proved popular with technicians as the way it functioned actually reduced wear and tear on the laser systems.

The initial production variant used a more conventional flamer instead of a more modern version that tapped into the mech's fusion plant.  This initial version could jettison the storage tanks away from the mech in case of emergencies.

The use of advanced technologies on the Hermes did force downgrades onto the Hermes as the Succession Wars raged.

Deployment: The Hermes popularity ensured it was always a rare mech in comparison to it's contemporaries.  Despite this the Succession Wars ensured that the Hermes proliferated to the other realms and saw heavy use.  Despite Irian producing the Hermes II during the Succession Wars enough secondary manufacturers and storehouses of Hermes ensured that combat loses of the Hermes never resulted in it becoming an extinct design.
