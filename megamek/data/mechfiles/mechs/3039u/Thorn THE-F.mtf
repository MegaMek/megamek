Overview: One of the older Terran Hegemony and Star League light 'Mechs, the Thorn was originally debuted in the late twenty-fourth century.  According to survivng records from the period, the Thorn was the first BattleMech to mount an Endo-Steel II internal structure.  This allowed the design to save significant weight on its chasis at the expense of increased bulk taking up what would otherwise be valuable space for additional equipment. The Second Succession War was unkind to the Thorn, as it was to many other designs of the era, by destroying the primary supplier of the materials needed to manufacture its Endo-Steel skeleton.  The ravages of the war continued to take their toll by ensuring other manufacturers could not take up the slack, resulting in a gradual extinction of the Thorn within the armies of the Successor States.

Capabilities: Reviews of the Thorn have always been mixed.  Hefty firepower for a design of its mass won it many supporters, but many commanders and MechWarriors find the lack of jump jets a significant drawback limiting the Thorn's usefulness. Pilots also complained that repeated firing of the Medium Laser directly under their feet made the cockpit uncomfortable despite the 'Mech's extensive cooling system. On the upside they did report that the Zeus LRM-5 proved extremely accurate, but this came at the cost of a poorly designed ammunition feed system that could lead to misfeeds in the system. Technicians, however, universaly enjoy working on the Thorn as it has large accessways in the limbs that allow for easy access to the interior of the 'Mech.

Deployment: The Thorn was a generally popular and widespread design during the height of the Star League. The onset of the Succession Wars saw it used by many interstellar powers, but the rapid decline of technology (along with the seizure of its main manufacturing plant by Terra on ComStar) lead to gradually dwindling numbers. Beyond ComStar's hidden armies, no Thorns remained in service within the Inner Sphere by the end of the Third Succession War. The original, lower-tech THE-F was no exception; though later emulated by the downgraded THE-S variant, no -F's lasted beyond the first major conflicts of the post-Star League era.
