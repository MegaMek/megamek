Overview: The Succession Wars changed procurement priorities for every Successor State in the Inner Sphere. Gone were many of the classic 'Mech formations and roles, all replaced by one simple concept: need. The Capellan Confederation understood that need well, perhaps better than every other great power. As such, when Ceres Metals was able to provide an inexpensive, tough, and mass-produced design with the Vindicator, House Liao snapped up the 'Mech without hesitation. It has since become one of the Confederation's flagship 'Mechs, serving in nearly every role within their military.

Capabilities: The Vindicator was a committee-designed BattleMech, one made to fill a multitude of roles. It is capable of fire support, defensive operations, direct assaults, and infightingâ€”none of which it does particularly well. This does not stop it from being a respected opponent. Its PPC remains a powerful weapon, and it has a more than adequate network of heat sinks installed throughout the chassis. Its low speed, combined with the natural armor limitations a 45-ton BattleMech has, are probably its greatest weakness.

Deployment: The Vindicator is near-exclusive to the Capellan Confederation. Many examples have been salvaged by other powers throughout the years, though the excessive price of all Vindicator components when sold to foreign powers makes upkeep a true nightmare. While this has not changed much over time, the Confederation has since eased maintanence for its closest allies, with favored mercenaries and the Magistracy of Canopus both fielding larger numbers then during the depths of the Succession Wars. The base VND-1R is representative of this approach, with the Confederation shifting many of these older Vindicators to their secondary markets.
