Overview: The Whitworth was originally conceived act as a mid-weight scouting complement to the Wasp and Phoenix Hawk BattleMechs. Originally armed with a blistering array of short-ranged firepower, this Whitworth faced excessive casualty rates as pilots would close to get the most out of their weaponry. Pressure from the SLDF would convince The Whitworth Company to replace its namesake's SRM launchers with LRM racks, increasing range and improving survivability.

Capabilities: The Whitworth is a competent light fire support platform. Although slower than most other scout platforms, a well positioned Whitworth can offer a powerful barrage of missiles or laser fire to support its lancemates. Its slower speed does make disengaging with enemy BattleMechs a more difficult task, causing Whitworths to be destroyed by the hundreds at the onset of the Succession Wars. The slender legs of the design cause undue stress to the actuator systems, and many Whitworths have had their legs replaced to avoid losing a valuable BattleMech to an untimely breakdown.

Deployment: The destruction of The Whitworth Company's complexes on Dieron early in the Succession Wars limited their number and quality during the ensuing conflicts. Often found in the hands of MechWarrior families, their condition would gradually decline until production of parts began anew in 3035. That these parts were produced in the Draconis Combine ensured that House Kurita would become of the premier users of the Whitworth. The Whitworth WTH-1 remained widely dispersed throughout the Inner Sphere, though none remained within the major Spheroid militaries by the end of the Jihad.
