Overview: The Assassin, though a serviceable BattleMech, was the result of industrial corruption and corner-cutting at its finest. Embellished and aggrandized, the capabilities of the Assassin were exaggerated enough for the BattleMech to enter production for the SLDF. Once its true capabilites were known, however, the 'Mech was quickly relegated to inferior markets, often ending up in the hands of militia or periphery units.

Capabilities: With its paltry array of weaponry, the Assassin was originally sold as a heavier alterative to the Stinger or the Wasp. In this, the 'Mech works as intended, but its reliance on ammunition led to its disfavor in many commands. On paper, however, the Assassin remains a popular alternative to these lighter 'Mechs due to its tougher armor, increased speed, and higher firepower. The design would find little favor amongst MechWarriors, though. With its intensely cramped cockpit and sub-par life support system, MechWarriors despised being forced to pilot the design. As if not enough, a common ammunition feed problem affecting the SRM launcher hardly helped the Assassin's already questionable popularity.

Deployment: Beginning as little more than a minor field modification, the ASN-23 is the most common Assassin variant visible on modern battlefields. The removal of the problematic SRM launcher freed enough spare tonnage to upgrade the medium weapon with newly-discovered pulse technology, while an Artemis fire control system was mated to the LRM launcher. Most older -21's and -23's were upgraded to this standard, though it took until 3067 for a major manufacturer to start production for the variant. The Assassin has since become a staple of Capellan and Capellan-allied forces.
