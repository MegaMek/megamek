overview:The Grand Titan was designed by Vining Engineering and Salvage Team to take on the best 'Mechs that the Inner Sphere or the Clans had to offer. 

capabilities:The 'Mech is built on an Endo Steel chassis and with a LTV 400 XL Engine, which propels the Grand Titan to a top speed of 64.8 kph, to save as much weight as possible. The Grand Titan also carries eighteen tons of armor.

deployment:The N11M model of the Grand Titan is a major modification of the design. The 'Mech carries as its primary long-range weapons a Light Gauss Rifle and an ER PPC which gives the 'Mech powerful long-range reach. The 'Mech has for short-range combat four Medium Pulse Lasers and two Streak SRM-4 launchers. It is also protected by a Guardian ECM Suite. This upgrade brings the Grand Titan to modern standards and makes it as powerful on the battlefield now as it was when it was first released.

history:The design of the Grand Titan was sold to Earthwerks Incorporated in the Free Worlds League and has become a 'Mech commonly seen in the FWLM and the Word of Blake militia.
