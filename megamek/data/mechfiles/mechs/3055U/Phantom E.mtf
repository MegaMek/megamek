overview:The Phantom was pushed into production by Khan Phelan Ward shortly before the Refusal War between Clan Wolf and Clan Jade Falcon, designed around Khan Ward's extensive experience with Inner Sphere tactics.

capabilities:Intended to push a medium reconnaisance 'Mech to the most extreme limits, the Phantom is built on a lightweight Type-A Endo Steel chassis and is propelled to a top speed of 151.2 km/h by a Light Force 360 XL Engine. The Phantom also boasts strong protection for its size with six tons of Composite A-2 Ferro-Fibrous armor.

deployment:The E configuration of the Phantom carries an ATM-3 launcher that can fire long, medium, and short range munitions that become deadlier as ranges close. For close combat, the 'Mech has eight Micro Pulse Lasers.

history:After the Wars of Reaving, the Phantom replaced the Fire Moth Omnimech for the remaining Home Clans because of its similar role and heavier profile.
