overview:The Phantom was pushed into production by Khan Phelan Ward shortly before the Refusal War between Clan Wolf and Clan Jade Falcon, designed around Khan Ward's extensive experience with Inner Sphere tactics.

capabilities:Intended to push a medium reconnaisance 'Mech to the most extreme limits, the Phantom is built on a lightweight Type-A Endo Steel chassis and is propelled to a top speed of 151.2 km/h by a Light Force 360 XL Engine. The Phantom also boasts strong protection for its size with six tons of Composite A-2 Ferro-Fibrous armor.

deployment:In its primary configuration the Phantom is an electronics marvel. To root out hidden units, the Phantom carries an Active Probe which is able to find hidden enemy units at up to one hundred and eighty meters. The Phantom prime is capable of spotting for friendly Arrow IV artillery with a TAG laser designator and, for protection from enemy electronic warfare systems, the 'Mech has an ECM Suite. To engage its enemies at long range, the Phantom has an LRM-5 launcher backed up by an ER Medium Laser and an ER Small Laser for close combat.

history:After the Wars of Reaving, the Phantom replaced the Fire Moth Omnimech for the remaining Home Clans because of its similar role and heavier profile.
