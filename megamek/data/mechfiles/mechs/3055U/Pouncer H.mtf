overview:The Pouncer was originally a testbed design that was upgraded to combat specifications on the orders of then ilKhan Ulric Kerensky, as it was realized that a more mobile 'Mech was needed when combating Inner Sphere forces.

capabilities:Overall, the Pouncer is an excellent OmniMech with 15.5 tons of pod space, allowing it to carry a wide variety of weapons payloads.

deployment:The H configuration is a dedicated brawler. The 'Mech carries as its primary weapons four heavy medium lasers and a heavy small laser, all of which are linked to a targeting computer. The 'Mech also carries two Streak SRM-6 launchers giving it impressive close range firepower.

history:The Pouncer is built on a lightweight DSAM Endo 4 endo steel chassis and is powered by a 240-rated XL engine which gives it a maximum speed of 97.2 km/h. The 'Mech's mobility is enhanced with five Grandthrust Mk. Four jump jets that allow it to jump up to 150 meters. For protection from enemy fire, the Pouncer has a respectable six tons of Forging ZM15 ferro-fibrous armor. The last of the Nova factories on Tokasha were later retooled to create Pouncers after the Wars of Reaving.
