overview:The Pouncer was originally a testbed design that was upgraded to combat specifications on the orders of then ilKhan Ulric Kerensky, as it was realized that a more mobile 'Mech was needed when combating Inner Sphere forces.

capabilities:Overall, the Pouncer is an excellent OmniMech with 15.5 tons of pod space, allowing it to carry a wide variety of weapons payloads.

deployment:In its Primary Configuration the Pouncer greatly resembles the Adder OmniMech which it shares much of its design concepts with. The Pouncer has two ER PPCs for long range striking power. These are backed up by a single ER small laser for close combat. All of the weapons on the Pouncer Prime are linked to an advanced targeting computer that increases their accuracy.

history:The Pouncer is built on a lightweight DSAM Endo 4 endo steel chassis and is powered by a 240-rated XL engine which gives it a maximum speed of 97.2 km/h. The 'Mech's mobility is enhanced with five Grandthrust Mk. Four jump jets that allow it to jump up to 150 meters. For protection from enemy fire, the Pouncer has a respectable six tons of Forging ZM15 ferro-fibrous armor. The last of the Nova factories on Tokasha were later retooled to create Pouncers after the Wars of Reaving.
