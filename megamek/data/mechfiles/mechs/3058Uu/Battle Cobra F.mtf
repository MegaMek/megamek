overview:The Battle Cobra was already in the prototype stages when Clan Steel Viper introduced their first OmniMech, the Crossbow.

capabilities:The Battle Cobra makes use of Endo Steel and Ferro-Fibrous technologies, but uses a standard Fusion Engine for increased durability. 

deployment:A mid-range Jump Jet equipped brawler, the F config mounts an Ultra AC/5 and single ton of reloads in its right arm supported by a trio of ER Medium Lasers in its left.

history:The Battle Cobra prototypes were quickly redesigned to allow similar arm-mounted Omni-Pods, debuting only a few years later. Like the Crossbow, the Battle Cobra does not mount fixed jump jets and cannot mount them in their arms - therefore, early Battle Cobras would not be jump-capable. The first of the design saw deployment in 2873, and even though all of its weapon mounts are in the arms, this 'Mech has been in production ever since.  However, the 'Mech's production facilities in Clan Space would end up being destroyed during the Annihilation of of Clan Steel Viper in 3075 on New Kent.
