overview:An early Clan assault OmniMech that may have influenced all subsequent assault OmniMech design, the Kingfisher is rugged and maneuverable. These traits make the Kingfisher an ideal choice for take and hold missions.

capabilities:The tough Kingfisher mounts fourteen and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor on an Endo Steel chassis, the most it can take. Unlike most modern front-line OmniMechs, the Kingfisher uses a standard engine. The 'Mech also has seventeen fixed double heat sinks, forcing three to be mounted outside of the engine.

deployment:The primary configuration of the Kingfisher is best at medium-short range. An LRM-10 launcher is its only legitimate long-range threat. A pair of Large and Medium Pulse Lasers are very accurate and the Streak SRM-6 cannot fire unless it achieves a target lock, making it ideally suited to green pilots and urban environments. An arm-mounted ER Small Laser seems superfluous.

history:Based off the powerful but dezgra Pulverizer, Clan Snow Raven debuted the Kingfisher in 2887 as an early second-generation OmniMech, the Kingfisher's speed and relative invulnerability have kept it in heavy use even during the Clan Invasion era, especially by Clan Ghost Bear, alongside more recent assault OmniMechs like the Executioner.
