overview:The Merlin uses components that are all reliable and readily available, making the Merlin a durable and easy-to-repair 'Mech. 

capabilities:The 'Mech is powered by a Pitban 240 fusion engine that gives it a top speed of 64.8 km/h. The Merlin carries ten and a half tons of armor, which is a respectable amount of protection for its weight. Additionally, the Merlin carries eighteen heat sinks to handle its heavy heat load.

deployment:The Merlin is armed to be able to engage an enemy at any range. For long range combat, the 'Mech carries a Magna Hellstar PPC and a Holly LRM-5 launcher. To protect itself at medium to short ranges, a pair of Martell Model 5 medium lasers provide the Merlin with respectable short range firepower. Finally, to protect the 'Mech against infantry attacks, the Merlin has a Zippo Flamer and a Sperry Browning Machine Gun. Four Pitban LFT-50 series jump jets allow the 'Mech to travel up to 120 meters in the air.

history:The Merlin debuted in 3010 as a product of the rebuilt Mountain Wolf BattleMechs. The Merlin was hailed as a technological marvel at the time it was released, as it was the first completely new design to be developed in over 100 years.
