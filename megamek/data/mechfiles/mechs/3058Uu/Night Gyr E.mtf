overview:The Night Gyr came back with Clan Jade Falcon leaders following their return to the Clan homeworlds in 3051 to elect a new ilKhan. It has become more prevalent in the Falcon touman following the Refusal War. 

capabilities:No expense was spared in the manufacture of this OmniMech that uses an XL Engine and Endo Steel to save weight. It also incorporates eleven and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. Though it is on the slow end for a Clan heavy 'Mech, the Night Gyr mounts four fixed jump jets that enable it to jump up to 120 meters in a single bound. The design was a testbed for some new technologies, including the Laser Heat Sink, which was eventually phased out due to a lack of increased performance.

deployment:This variant uses massed pulse lasers, two large and six medium, in conjunction with an ATM 6 and an SRM-6. The ATM only mounts two tons of ammunition, limiting its flexibility.

history:During the Wars of Reaving, Night Gyr's production facilities on Ironhold, would end up being destroyed in 3076.
