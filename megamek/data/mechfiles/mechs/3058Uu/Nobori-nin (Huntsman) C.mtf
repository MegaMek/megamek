overview:Exemplifying the OmniMech concept, the flexible Huntsman was the premier medium 'Mech of Clan Nova Cat during Operation REVIVAL. 

deployment:This long-range support variant uses an LRM-20, LRM-15, and an Ultra Autocannon/5 for most of its work. An ER Medium Laser, ER Small Laser, and Streak SRM-4 handle units that get in close. A Flamer provides defense against infantry and combat vehicles.

capabilities:No expense has been spared in the construction of this front-line OmniMech that uses an Extra-Light Engine, Endo Steel structure, and nine tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. Five jump jets enable it to leap up to 150 meters at a time.

history:First seen within the 119th Nova Cat Striker Cluster during the Battle of Luthien, a Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery intelligence officer dubbed the OmniMech with the name of "Nobori-nin" (Japanese for "Banner-bearer") due to the single fin-like projection rising from the back of the 'Mech reminding him of the banner samurai worn on their backs in feudal Japan. Prized for its flexibility across a wide range of opponents and battlefield conditions, the Huntsman was almost exclusively a Nova Cat design during the initial Clan Invasion, but prior to the Word of Blake Jihad had entered service with Clans Diamond Shark, Cloud Cobra and Star Adder.
