overview:Exemplifying the OmniMech concept, the flexible Huntsman was the premier medium 'Mech of Clan Nova Cat during Operation REVIVAL. 

deployment:The primary configuration of the Huntsman sports a myriad of weapons. An Ultra Autocannon/2 and Artemis IV-linked LRM-10 provide long-range capability, while four ER Medium Lasers and a Streak SRM-6 make it a vicious close range 'Mech. A pair of Anti-Personnel Pods and a Flamer protect it from conventional infantry, and an Anti-Missile System provides it with some defense against incoming missiles. An Active Probe finds hidden units, and a TAG spotting laser can designate targets for homing artillery strikes.

capabilities:No expense has been spared in the construction of this front-line OmniMech that uses an Extra-Light Engine, Endo Steel structure, and nine tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. Five jump jets enable it to leap up to 150 meters at a time.

history:First seen within the 119th Nova Cat Striker Cluster during the Battle of Luthien, a Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery intelligence officer dubbed the OmniMech with the name of "Nobori-nin" (Japanese for "Banner-bearer") due to the single fin-like projection rising from the back of the 'Mech reminding him of the banner samurai worn on their backs in feudal Japan. Prized for its flexibility across a wide range of opponents and battlefield conditions, the Huntsman was almost exclusively a Nova Cat design during the initial Clan Invasion, but prior to the Word of Blake Jihad had entered service with Clans Diamond Shark, Cloud Cobra and Star Adder.
