overview:The Shadow Cat is a heavily-armed and maneuverable medium OmniMech developed by Clan Nova Cat to replace the Ice Ferret in the early 31st century during preparations for Operation Revival.
capabilities:This expensive OmniMech makes use of weight-saving technologies in the form of an Endo Steel internal structure, an XL Engine, and seven tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. All of these together allow the Shadow Cat to employ more pod space than the Ice Ferret at the expense of speed. To counteract this, the base chassis employs enough jump jets to vault up to 180 meters in a single bound and Myomer Accelerated Signal Circuitry that enables it to move up to 130 km/h in bursts.

The primary configuration of the Shadow Cat wields a Gauss Rifle allowing it to handily defeat smaller opponents, often before they can get within range. A pair of smaller ER Medium Lasers back up the rifle, together able to deal almost as much damage as the gauss rifle can. An Active Probe gives the Shadow Cat the ability to detect hidden units, making it a capable scout
deployment:Use of the Shadow Cat has spread to other Clans since its introduction, most notably, the Annihilated Clan Smoke Jaguar, Clan Cloud Cobra, Clan Fire Mandrill, Clan Steel Viper, Clan Diamond Shark and Clan Wolf.  First encountered by Inner Sphere forces at the Battle of Luthien, the Shadow Cat was subsequently used by the Clans during the Battle of Tukayyid against ComStar. It is one of the few invasion-era Clan 'Mechs to lack a separate Inner Sphere designation; all Inner-Sphere pilots who encountered it before Tukayyid died, and ComStar was informed of its designation before that battle, resulting in both sides using the same name.

notes:The Shadow Cat was such a successful design that it has seen continued production by Clan Nova Cat well into the Dark Age period.
