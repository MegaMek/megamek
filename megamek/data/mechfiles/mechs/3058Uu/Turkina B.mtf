overview:The Turkina is a powerful OmniMech that was first seen in the Turkina Keshik at the Battle of Tukayyid, and entered general service with Clan Jade Falcon following the end of the Refusal War. In a design oddity, the Turkina mounts enough jump jets to vault 90 meters hardwired onto the frame, rather than using them in modular pods. While this simplified repair, it also uses tonnage that could be devoted to other systems when a mission does not call for jumping. Designers also included fifteen double heat sinks, four more than could be fit into the engine, so they are fixed in the torso. The Turkina has 42 tons available for modular pods.

capabilities:Continuing with the paired weapons theme, the B uses two Large Pulse Lasers, ER Large Lasers, Medium Pulse Lasers, and ER Medium Lasers. All of these are linked to an advanced Targeting Computer. Ten extra double heat sinks still struggle to keep heat levels down.[6] The impetus for this variant seems to lie in the Battle of Tukayyid and the ComGuard's strategy of bleeding them of supplies by fighting a protracted campaign. With no weapons that need ammunition, this configuration can stay in the field as long as its MechWarrior can.

history:The Turkina is named after Turkina, the first Jade Falcon to be tamed, who inspired the leaders of Clan Jade Falcon in its early days. The name of the Turkina Keshik is also derived from this bird.
