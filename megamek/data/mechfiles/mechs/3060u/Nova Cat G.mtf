overview:A Nova Cat heavy OmniMech built to protect the Nova Cats spiritually and militarily.
 
capabilities:The basic components of this design, combined with its characteristics as an OmniMech, make it very simple to repair and leave room for the large amount of double heat sinks most variants carry. 13 Â½ tons of standard armor make this 'Mech very difficult to kill.

deployment:Another configuration developed during the Jihad, this configuration was developed for the fire support and anti-infantry role. The config, like the F, is given a Targeting Computer and ECM suite. For fire-support role, it has been given three Artemis IV guided LRM-20 launchers in the arms with five tons of ammunition. For its anti-infantry role, it has been given eight AP Gauss Rifles split between the two torsos. The guns shares a ton ammunition between them.

history:After its defeat on Tukayyid, Khan Severen Leroux of Clan Nova Cat commissioned the Nova Cat OmniMech, meant to protect the Clan both militarily and spiritually. The 12 meter tall 'Mech is inspired by the Night Gyr created by Clan Jade Falcon.
