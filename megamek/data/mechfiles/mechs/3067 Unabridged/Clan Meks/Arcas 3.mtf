overview: First produced in 3061, the Arcas is expensive for a second-line 'Mech. 

capabilities:It utilizes an XL Engine that enables it to move up to 86 km/h and jump jets for a maximum jump capacity of one hundred fifty meters at a time. The Arcas mounts thirteen and a half tons of standard armor, the most a 'Mech of its size can carry. This version carries a Targeting Computer to counteract the inaccuracy of its Heavy Large Laser. A Streak SRM-4 and pair of Medium Pulse Lasers rounds out the armament. Seven Improved Jump Jets allow the Arcas 3 to cover 210 meters in a single jump. 

history:Following the move of Clan Ghost Bear to the Inner Sphere, Khan Bjorn Jorgensson ordered the creation of a new BattleMech. The Arcas was designed as a symbol to mark the beginning of a new era, so Loremaster Laurie Tseng named it after a character in the mythology of the Greeks who eventually became the constellation known as Ursa Minor.
