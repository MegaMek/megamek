overview:The Savage Coyote OmniMech was created as a showcase OmniMech. The 'Mech was also part of Khan Koga's attempts to revitalize the fading Clan that invented the OmniMech.

capabilities:This assault 'Mech uses an XL Engine to save enough weight to devote forty-five tons of space to modular equipment and fifteen tons of armor. The base chassis contains fourteen fixed double heat sinks.

deployment:This version uses five Improved Jump Jets to provide a 150 meter jump radius. It carries nineteen double heat sinks to dissipate the heat from four Small Pulse Lasers, two ER Large Lasers, a Large Pulse Laser, and an LB 10-X Autocannon.

history:Following the development of Advanced Tactical Missile technology. The creation of the Savage Coyote was a direct result of both the warriors of Clan Coyote clamoring for new weapons to use and the election of Khan Sullivan Koga in 3052.
