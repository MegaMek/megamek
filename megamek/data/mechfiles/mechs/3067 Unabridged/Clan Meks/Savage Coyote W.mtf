overview:The Savage Coyote OmniMech was created as a showcase OmniMech. The 'Mech was also part of Khan Koga's attempts to revitalize the fading Clan that invented the OmniMech.

capabilities:This assault 'Mech uses an XL Engine to save enough weight to devote forty-five tons of space to modular equipment and fifteen tons of armor. The base chassis contains fourteen fixed double heat sinks.

deployment:Like the J configuration, this version uses five Improved Jump Jets. It also has twenty double heat sinks. It's equipped with four Large Pulse Lasers, two Small Pulse Lasers, two Flamers, and an ER Medium Laser. It also has a Light TAG and Light Active Probe.

history:Following the development of Advanced Tactical Missile technology. The creation of the Savage Coyote was a direct result of both the warriors of Clan Coyote clamoring for new weapons to use and the election of Khan Sullivan Koga in 3052.
