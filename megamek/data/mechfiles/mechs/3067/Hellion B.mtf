overview:The Hellion is a product of Clan Ice Hellion and their philosophy that espouses speed above all else. Based on the Mist Lynx, the Hellion is a fast OmniMech that has respectable firepower.
 
capabilities:This light 'Mech is rather difficult to kill, incorporating five and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. To save weight, the Hellion also uses an Endo Steel chassis. While it is not especially fast for its size, the Hellion does use MASC to allow for bursts of additional speed.

deployment:A dangerous heavy laser configuration, the Hellion B has a Heavy Large Laser, four Heavy Medium Lasers, and a Heavy Small Laser. Added to all this laser power are three additional double heat sinks. Even with the extra heat sinks, the Hellion B will not last long firing all of its weapons.
