overview:The Legacy was produced as a testbed for new technologies, including the Ultra AC/10 and C3i Computer.
capabilities:They upgraded its targeting system and included the C3i, which allows six units to coordinate fire. Its thick armor protection, standard fusion engine, and CASE give the Legacy remarkable staying power on the battlefield. One of the weaknesses of the 'Mech is its slow speed compared to other 'Mechs of similar size, but the inclusion of jump jets sought to counter that with superior maneuverability.
deployment:The -02 variant is designed as a missile boat, replacing the Ultra AC/10s with two Doombud LRM-20s, three tons of ammo for each, and a pair of Medium Pulse Lasers.
history:At the request of Word of Blake Precentor Martial Cameron St. Jamais. The designers used a failed Star League 'Mech called the Rising Star as the base for the Legacy.
