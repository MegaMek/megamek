overview:The Savage Coyote OmniMech was created as a showcase OmniMech. The 'Mech was also part of Khan Koga's attempts to revitalize the fading Clan that invented the OmniMech.

capabilities:This assault 'Mech uses an XL Engine to save enough weight to devote forty-five tons of space to modular equipment and fifteen tons of armor. The base chassis contains fourteen fixed double heat sinks.

deployment:This variant is effective at all ranges. A pair of ER Large Lasers and a Large Pulse Laser combine with an Ultra Autocannon/5 to provide an effective long-range punch. Six Small Pulse Lasers aid at knife-fighting range and can quickly devastate conventional infantry. Two pairs of ATM 3s provide support at all ranges.

history:Following the development of Advanced Tactical Missile technology. The creation of the Savage Coyote was a direct result of both the warriors of Clan Coyote clamoring for new weapons to use and the election of Khan Sullivan Koga in 3052.
