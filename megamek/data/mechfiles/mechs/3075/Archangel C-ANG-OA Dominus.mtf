overview:Debuting in 3069, the Celestial series of OmniMechs are engineered to be used by the elite Word of Blake Manei Domini troops.
 
capabilities:The Archangel is the largest of these. Designed to be an "anchor" for Word formations, the 'Mech is known as a "zombie" because of its ability to take extreme amounts of damage and continue operating. The Archangel features a compact fusion engine, compact gyro, a small cockpit, and nineteen and a half tons of standard armor, which frees up a large amount of internal space, while an Endo Steel frame opens up free tonnage, making heavier components possible. A C3i Computer helps direct and coordinate fire.

history:The Dominus configuration is armed with a pair of arm-mounted Heavy PPCs, giving it powerful ranged combat capabilities. It also has a Snub-Nose PPC and a pair of ER Medium Lasers mounted in the head and center torso, respectively, giving it a powerful close range punch. Eight additional double heat sinks keep the 'Mech's heat under control.
