overview:Debuting in 3069, the Celestial series of OmniMechs are engineered to be used by the elite Word of Blake Manei Domini troops.
 
capabilities:The Archangel is the largest of these. Designed to be an "anchor" for Word formations, the 'Mech is known as a "zombie" because of its ability to take extreme amounts of damage and continue operating. The Archangel features a compact fusion engine, compact gyro, a small cockpit, and nineteen and a half tons of standard armor, which frees up a large amount of internal space, while an Endo Steel frame opens up free tonnage, making heavier components possible. A C3i Computer helps direct and coordinate fire.

history:Similar in some respects to the Dominus, the Infernus also mounts a Heavy PPC in the arm, but the other arm contains two Light PPCs. The weight saved allows the Archangel B to carry two Snub-Nose PPCs.
