overview:Debuting in 3069, the Celestial series of OmniMechs are engineered to be used by the elite Word of Blake Manei Domini troops.
 
capabilities:The Archangel is the largest of these. Designed to be an "anchor" for Word formations, the 'Mech is known as a "zombie" because of its ability to take extreme amounts of damage and continue operating. The Archangel features a compact fusion engine, compact gyro, a small cockpit, and nineteen and a half tons of standard armor, which frees up a large amount of internal space, while an Endo Steel frame opens up free tonnage, making heavier components possible. A C3i Computer helps direct and coordinate fire.

history:The odd variant out, the Archangel C eschews PPCs in favor of two MRM 40s, each of which are fed by a two-ton, CASE-protected ammunition bin. They are supplemented by a pair of ER Medium Lasers and a rear-mounted ER Small Laser. A Guardian ECM Suite protects it from enemy electronics.
