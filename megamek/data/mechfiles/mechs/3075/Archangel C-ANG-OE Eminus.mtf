overview:Debuting in 3069, the Celestial series of OmniMechs are engineered to be used by the elite Word of Blake Manei Domini troops.
 
capabilities:The Archangel is the largest of these. Designed to be an "anchor" for Word formations, the 'Mech is known as a "zombie" because of its ability to take extreme amounts of damage and continue operating. The Archangel features a compact fusion engine, compact gyro, a small cockpit, and nineteen and a half tons of standard armor, which frees up a large amount of internal space, while an Endo Steel frame opens up free tonnage, making heavier components possible. A C3i Computer helps direct and coordinate fire.

history:The Eminus variant is similar in many respects to the Luminos with its pair of arm-mounted ER PPCs. It differs in that it is ground-bound and more focused on long range. It only carries a pair of ER Small Lasers to supplement its damage potential up close. Instead, it mounts an ER Large Laser and a Light PPC. The inclusion of a Targeting Computer makes all the weapons more accurate.
