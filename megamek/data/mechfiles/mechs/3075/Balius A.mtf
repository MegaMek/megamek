overview:The Balius is a quadrupedal, front-line OmniMech produced by Clan Hell's Horses. 

capabilities:The Balius, a true frontline Omni, employs weight-saving technologies such as an Endo Steel chassis, eleven tons of ferro-fibrous armor, and an XL engine. In a quad, though, this leaves limited room for other components. The Balius, on the other hand, has a top speed of 97 km/h, which is fairly fast for a 'Mech of its size. The Balius is equipped with a Creosote Special-H Flamer that can be used against troops as well as as a psychological weapon.

deployment:Mounting the Horses' newest weapon, the Balius A has a HAG 20. It also carries an ER Large Laser to supplement that weapon at range. An ER Medium Laser provides additional firepower up close, while another pair of the same protect its back.

history:As of 3075, few details were available about the 'Mech. It is a totem 'Mech, resembling a horse, that is meant to improve morale as much as to be an effective combat unit. There is apparently no factory producing this design. Instead, it is hand-crafted by a crew of technicians specifically selected for the task by the Khan. This has led to few Balius' being produced, so the 'Mech is only in the hands of select Bloodnamed warriors.
