overview:The Grigori is one of the Word of Blake's new Celestial series OmniMechs designed by Doctor Devon Cortland.

capabilities:It is constructed on a standard chassis, but makes use of eleven tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor, a light fusion engine, and an XL Gyro; as well as the small cockpit that is common to all of the Celestials. Like the other Celestials, the Grigori has a C3i Computer to help direct its fire.

deployment:Poltergeist Precentor Sigma Tamiel of the 47th Shadow Division uses a custom weapons configuration. His Grigori mounts two Thunderbolt 10 missile launchers and a Snub-Nose PPC. A head-mounted Guardian ECM Suite provides an additional layer of defense. For increased mobility, the Grigori Tamiel carries four Jump Jets.

history:The Grigori (named after fallen angels from Christianity) was added to the Word of Blake Militia's arsenal in late 3069 as Doctor Cortland oversaw the final production personally.
