overview:The Grigori is one of the Word of Blake's new Celestial series OmniMechs designed by Doctor Devon Cortland.

capabilities:It is constructed on a standard chassis, but makes use of eleven tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor, a light fusion engine, and an XL Gyro; as well as the small cockpit that is common to all of the Celestials. Like the other Celestials, the Grigori has a C3i Computer to help direct its fire.

deployment:Another missile-heavy variant, the Grigori B mounts an Artemis IV-guided MML 7 in each arm. A Plasma Rifle provides respectable firepower and forces conventional units to reconsider attacking the Infernus variant. A Medium Pulse Laser provides a more accurate weapon. A rear-mounted ER Small Laser makes small units think twice about attacking the 'Mech's rear. Like the Invictus, this configuration can also jump up to 120 meters.

history:The Grigori (named after fallen angels from Christianity) was added to the Word of Blake Militia's arsenal in late 3069 as Doctor Cortland oversaw the final production personally.
