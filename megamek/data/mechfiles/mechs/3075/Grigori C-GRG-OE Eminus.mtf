overview:The Grigori is one of the Word of Blake's new Celestial series OmniMechs designed by Doctor Devon Cortland.

capabilities:It is constructed on a standard chassis, but makes use of eleven tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor, a light fusion engine, and an XL Gyro; as well as the small cockpit that is common to all of the Celestials. Like the other Celestials, the Grigori has a C3i Computer to help direct its fire.

deployment:The Eminus configuration carries an experimental Thunderbolt 15 and two tons of ammunition. An ER PPC supplements its fire at range. If an enemy gets closer, the Grigori E can do more damage with five ER Medium Lasers and an ER Small. 

history:The Grigori (named after fallen angels from Christianity) was added to the Word of Blake Militia's arsenal in late 3069 as Doctor Cortland oversaw the final production personally.
