overview:The Malak is the lightest in the Word of Blake's Celestial series of OmniMechs designed for the Manei Domini. The Malak, Arabic for "angel," features a dazzling array of new construction materials in an attempt to free up as much weight as possible in a fast and reliable package.

capabilities:The 'Mech is protected with six tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor which weighs less than standard armor. To free up even more space, the 'Mech mounts an XL Gyro, and a small cockpit in addition to its Endo Steel frame. A C3i Computer allows it to sync with other Manei Domini so equipped. Nine and a half tons are left for modular equipment.

deployment:The A configuration of this scout 'Mech uses a pair of ER Medium Lasers as its heavy weapons. Two sets of three Light Machine Guns, each linked to a Machine Gun Array, give the 'Mech the capability to devastate conventional infantry, as can the pair of torso-mounted Flamers. A single ER Small Laser rounds out the weapons array.
