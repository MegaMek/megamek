overview:The light assault 'Mech of the Celestial series of OmniMechs, the Seraph is somewhat slow for its weight, but it attempts to make up for that with the inclusion of Triple-Strength Myomer that enables the 'Mech to speed up to 64 kph when it runs hot.

capabilities:Like the other Celestials, the Seraph makes use of a light fusion engine and a small cockpit, though other newer technologies are present only in its weaponry. As with the other Celestials, a C3i Computer is included. The main criticism of the Seraph Invictus is that it does not make very good use of its Triple-Strength Myomer. The design does not build enough heat to activate the musculature, a problem the Streak missile system only exacerbates.

deployment:This variant uses a Heavy PPC to deliver a strong punch, and a Plasma Rifle to deal both damage and heat. An ER Medium Laser and a Medium Pulse Laser provide close support, while the Target Acquisition Gear threatens opponents with homing artillery. A Targeting Computer helps these weapons find their mark, and Improved Jump Jets allow the Seraph Dominus to move up to a hundred fifty meters at a time.
