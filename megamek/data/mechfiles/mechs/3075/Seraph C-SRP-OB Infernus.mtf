overview:The light assault 'Mech of the Celestial series of OmniMechs, the Seraph is somewhat slow for its weight, but it attempts to make up for that with the inclusion of Triple-Strength Myomer that enables the 'Mech to speed up to 64 kph when it runs hot.

capabilities:Like the other Celestials, the Seraph makes use of a light fusion engine and a small cockpit, though other newer technologies are present only in its weaponry. As with the other Celestials, a C3i Computer is included. The main criticism of the Seraph Invictus is that it does not make very good use of its Triple-Strength Myomer. The design does not build enough heat to activate the musculature, a problem the Streak missile system only exacerbates.

deployment:Vicious up close or at range, the Seraph B also uses a Targeting Computer to aid its accuracy. Up close it can use its LB-X Autocannon/20, which is capable of firing slugs that can tear holes in an enemy's armor or cluster munitions that spread damage out. Three tons of ammunition is protected by CASE. Also protected by the CASE is the ammo bin for the Anti-Missile System. Farther out, the Infernus variant makes use of a Heavy PPC. Useful at all ranges is the Snub-Nose PPC, though it deals more damage up close.
