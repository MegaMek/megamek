overview:The Arctic Wolf II is a Clan Wolf-in-Exile Medium OmniMech that was developed during the Jihad, and finally deployed in 3085. 

capabilities:The design is based on the OmniMech variant of the original Arctic Wolf. The original OmniMech version had a number of problems, including technical glitches and a lack of speed. The Arctic Wolf II addresses speed concerns by using the original Arctic Wolf's Light Force 280 rated XL Fusion Engine. Seven Grandthrust Mk. 4 Jump Jets were also installed to increase the Mech's tactical options and exploit capabilities that were gained from the failed OmniMech J Configuration. The 'Mech has over 14 tons of pod space available for its techs to install weapons and equipment. Perhaps one of the Arctic Wolf II's only weaknesses is its light armor protection, boasting only 6.5 ton of Ferro Fibrous armor.

deployment:The Wolves created the C configuration to fill the role of a fast harasser. It comes with a pair of arm mounted ER Large Lasers for ranged attacks. For short ranges, the "C" is equipped with a pair of torso mounted SRM 4 Launchers with two tons of ammunition. A single Double Heat Sink is added to help with the Mech's increased heat loads.
