overview:The Pack Hunter II is a light BattleMech produced by Clan Wolf-in-Exile on Arc-Royal during the Jihad.

capabilities:The 'Mech's legs are protected from possible Battle Armor attack by having a B-Pod mounted in each leg. The 'Mech's weapons and movement heat is managed by 10 Double Heat Sinks, but it's not adequate enough to handle the 'Mech's heat load.

deployment:A variant created in 3078 due to sabotages and shortages of XL Fusion Engines, this Mix-Tech version of the Pack Hunter II must make do with a Light Fusion Engine. Due to the weight of the Inner Sphere engine, engineers would drop both ER Medium Lasers and exchanges its B-Pods for A-Pods. However, the room made up for dropped equipment allows for it to have 5 tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor.

history:The 'Mech would first appear in combat in 3077 after a considerable amount of delays in its development. The design was originally seen as the OmniMech successor to the original Pack Hunter, however the Blakist attack against Arc-Royal and other priorities caused the delays. The Pack Hunter II improves on its predecessorâ€™s qualities. Among the things the 'Mech has been fitted with, the designers made a substantial improvement in armor and weaponry while retaining the original's speed. In a bid to improve survival rates of pilots, the design also includes a Full-Head Ejection System to prevent the loss of a warrior in combat. The design had been seen deployed by 3085 with toumans of Clan Hell's Horses, the Draconis Combine and the Republic of the Sphere
