overview:The Rifleman IIC is an upgrade of the venerable Rifleman BattleMech. Five tons heavier than the design it is based on, the Rifleman IIC is also slower. 

capabilities:Five tons heavier than the design it is based on, the Rifleman IIC is also slower. This creates a great deal more room with which to mount other equipment. Further weight savings are found in the use of an Endo Steel frame. One of the first upgrades to the design was maxing out its protection, with eleven tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. 

deployment:The IIC 4 retains two of the Large Pulse Lasers from the base variant, but adds a pair of ATM 9s, each of which can draw on two tons of ammunition. Sixteen double heat sinks are all that is needed to keep all heat from the weapons under control. 

history:An ancient rebuild of an already ancient design, the Rifleman IIC has soldiered on throughout the centuries. The â€™Mech can be found in service with most Clans (a
notable exception is Clan Wolf, which prefers the Glass Spider) and several Inner Sphere powers. Its simplicity is matched only by its effectiveness, and new variants
continue to debut.
