overview:The Gyrfalcon, a successor to Olivetti Weaponry’s Eyrie, was unveiled by the Jade Falcons twenty-five years after the Eyrie's introduction. Developed as part of a Clan Council initiative to rejuvenate the touman during Devlin Stone’s peace, the Gyrfalcon was designed to inspire both the new generation and veteran warriors of the Jade Falcons. It embodies the Clan’s principles of pride, patriotism, and culture, proving to be a resounding success in both its battlefield role and as a symbol of Clan identity.

The Gyrfalcon's role in high-profile Trials of Possession and other Clan rituals further solidified its status as a symbol of Jade Falcon strength and ingenuity.</p><p>Throughout its service, the Gyrfalcon has been a key asset in Clan Jade Falcon's quest for supremacy.
