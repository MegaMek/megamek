overview:A Nova Cat heavy OmniMech built to protect the Nova Cats spiritually and militarily.
 
capabilities:The basic components of this design, combined with its characteristics as an OmniMech, make it very simple to repair and leave room for the large amount of double heat sinks most variants carry. 13 Â½ tons of standard armor make this 'Mech very difficult to kill.

deployment:This configuration carries an Improved Heavy Large Laser, two Medium Pulse Lasers, and a TSEMP Cannon in each arm. Twenty-one double heat sinks keep heat manageable.

history:After its defeat on Tukayyid, Khan Severen Leroux of Clan Nova Cat commissioned the Nova Cat OmniMech, meant to protect the Clan both militarily and spiritually. The 12 meter tall 'Mech is inspired by the Night Gyr created by Clan Jade Falcon.
