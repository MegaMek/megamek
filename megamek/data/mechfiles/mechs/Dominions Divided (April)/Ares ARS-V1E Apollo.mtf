overview:The Ares is a Superheavy Class Tripod OmniMech, which was first produced by the Republic of the Sphere.

capabilities:Designed as a Tripod, the 'Mech's unique method of movement gives the Ares the ability to handle turns without having to slow its pace. This is a benefit to the design due to its slow speed. Its lower rated engine and Endo-Composite construction allows the 'Mech to carry 41 tons of OmniPod encased weapons and equipment. The 'Mech is protected by 28.5 tons of Maximillian 320 standard armor, giving it hefty protection against enemy fire. Like all Superheavy Tripods, the Ares has a 3-man cockpit, which allows the 'Mech to perform better in combat than a normal single MechWarrior. This allows it to be able to target multiple enemies without penalty, a pilot focused on navigating the machine, and gaining a tactical advantage to allow it to serve as a command vehicle in battle. Each Ares carries a fixed array of weapons: on each leg a pair of Anti-Personnel Pods. On the 'Mech's torso each version of the Ares has a pair of Clan ER Medium Lasers, three Clan ER Small Lasers, three SRM 2 launchers, and a pair of LRM 5 launchers, giving the Ares series of 'Mechs a well-rounded base platform to start with.

deployment:No Information on Variant

history:The 'Mech's development began as Poseidon prototypes finished their trial runs in 3135. The Ares' appearance is due, in part, to its development cycle, which took place at nearly the same time as that of the Poseidon. The Ares' origins were virtually unknown during its initial deployment with the Republic's Stone's Brigades and units stationed at its factory world on Devil's Rock. During the 3140s, the Ares had been deployed to various worlds neighboring the Republic's in covert raids and recon missions as part of the nation's efforts to keep potential invaders off guard. Production of the 'Mech and its sister design, the Poseidon, continued on Devil's Rock at Rhodes Foundry. By 3145, the location of the factory had become a frontline world in danger of falling to a potential Clan Wolf invasion. Additional production was planned for Mars, with the facilities on Devil's Rock set to be razed should invasion forces arrive on world. A single Ares of uncertain configuration saw deployment in 3146 as part of Julian Davion's Dawn Guards. Upon gifting Julian the 'Mech, Devlin Stone warned him that keeping the machine in fighting trim was "a nightmare." Several Ares 'Mechs were deployed to Callison in 3149. The Republic made extensive use of the Ares during the Battle of Terra, especially in Operation Four Horsemen, against Clan Wolf. They proved to be a serious threat, stopping and even managing to make the Clanners retreat, but after the Wolves adjusted their tactics to them, all fell, one after another. During Terra's conquest, the Wolves salvaged an unknown number of Areses, managing to rebuild and repair some, using them in their Trial against Clan Jade Falcon; most of them, ironically, were crewed by former bondsmen of the RAF.[10] After the Trial, Wolf's Dragoons salvaged a number of Areses, disassembling some to study and replicate them. The new Dragoons leader, Colonel Henry Kincaid, gave six functional units, along with intel about them, to the Free Worlds League Captain-General Nikol Halas-Hughes Marik, though they still retained some for themselves. That same year, the League's First Free Worlds Guards fielded several Areses when deployed on Marik, twice as many as the Dragoons gave Nikol. Some were newly manufactured, which made the League the first Inner Sphere state to build them since the fall of the Republic.
