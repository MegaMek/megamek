history:After their withdrawal from the Pentagon, the clans built a handful of Devastators in preparation for Klondike. Using the best technology available, new improved gauss rifles were installed along with two tons of additional ammunition, another ton of armor and another medium laser. After Klondike, Wolverine engineers installed two Enhanced ER PPCs, updated the torso medium lasers and upgraded the heatsinks to help cope with the tremendous heat produced by the new weapons.
