overview:Designed to be sold to fellow Clans, this rebuild of the Timber Wolf carries thirteen tons of ferro-fibrous armor while being one of most nimble BattleMechs of its class, yet still packing serious weaponry.

capabilities:Produced on the Manufacturing Plant DSF-IT1 on Itabaiana. This version uses several Advanced Technology systems to increase its effectiveness on the battlefield. Each arm carries an ER Large Pulse Laser and an ER Medium Laser, while a pair of LRM-10's provide long range firepower. Four jump jets allow the Mad Cat Mk. II Enhanced to cover 120 meters at a time. The top speed of the 'Mech was reduced to 54 km/h, however, due to the use of twenty-five tons of Hardened Armor. This protection, outweighing some 'Mechs, ensures that the Mad Cat Mk. II-Enhanced can continue to fight long after most of its foes have been destroyed.

deployment:Despite this, Mk II's most notable potential buyers, Clan Wolf and Clan Jade Falcon, did not purchase even a single unit, though they won some numbers in Trials. Significant numbers of Mad Cat Mk II were sold to Clan Nova Cat, and the Mech served also in Clan Ice Hellion, Clan Jade Falcon, Clan Wolf-in-Exile  in addition to Diamond Shark itself. On a limited basis, Clan Diamond Shark sold unmodified Mad Cat Mk IIs to Inner Sphere factions, most notably the Draconis Combine and Federated Commonwealth, and also the Lyran Alliance bought an unknown amount of Mad Cat Mark IIs.

history:The Mad Cat Mk II was in development for fifteen months by the time production began in 3061. The sole rationale for the Mad Cat Mk II was to increase profits for Clan Diamond Shark after war with the Inner Sphere in the 3050s.
