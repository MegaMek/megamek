overview:The Bane is a BattleMech that is based upon a Star League prototype that was never put into production. Tagged the Kraken by Inner Sphere forces who opposed it.

capabilities:The Bane was first built in 2827. It was originally a significant part of many Clan toumans, but was gradually relegated to second-line status following the introduction of the OmniMech. As such, it is still critical to many defensive units. The design uses a lightweight XL Engine so that it can mount the arsenal that it does. Nineteen tons of armor protects this venerable assault 'Mech.

deployment:This variant is effective at both medium and short range. It trades out the autocannons for four Ultra Autocannon/10s. In addition, it is capable of spitting out almost twice the damage of the original. Fourteen tons of ammunition allow the Bane 2 to stay in the fight for a long time.
