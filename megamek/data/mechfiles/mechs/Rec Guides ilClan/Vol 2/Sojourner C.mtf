overview:Though introduced in 3147, its primarily intended for newly minted Clan Wolf-in-Exile MechWarriors, the Sojourner is a easy to pilot and easy to repair OmniMech.



deployment:The C config is a classic Missile Boat, mounting an LRM-20 rack in each side torso supported by a pair of Heavy Large Lasers in the right arm and a center torso mounted Micro Pulse Laser. Carrying four extra Double Heat Sinks, the Sojourner C is not easily silenced with a combined six tons of LRM reloads, divided between its two CASE II protected side-torsos.

capabilities:Intended to ease young MechWarriors into the subtleties of 'Mech combat, the configurations that fill the Sojourner's twenty-five and half tons of Pod Space are relatively simplistic, focused around the Actuator Enhancement System-enhanced right arm for main weaponry with supplementary support weaponry placed in the opposite torso. Structually the Sojourner is built around a Endo Steel frame and clad in ten and half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor, the use of a readily available and afforable Pitban 240-rated standard engine reduces costs but also reduces its average speed. The inclusion of a fixed Supercharger on the Sojourners chassis mitigates this to a degree, though it is intended to assist an out of their depth green warrior extricate themselves from an unfavorably battle rather than more rapidly close with their foes. Ten Double Heat Sinks built into the frame can be enhanced as a configuration requires.

history:The genesis of the Sojourner actually stems decades earlier with the post-Jihad Exiled Wolves drafting a simple and affordable OmniMech to bulk out their touman, only for the 'Mech to be passed over for production to appease Devlin Stone and his arms-reduction treaties. Though the Sojouner's active development was ceased, a generation of Exiled Wolf technicans and designers would continue to tinker and refine the design in a virtual lab for decades. With the crippled Clan Wolf-in-Exile limping to Donegal following their devastating defeat on Arc-Royal in 3146, Khan Miriam Shaw ordered a massive upscaling of production to rebuild her Clan. Rather than expand ATI's already at maximum capacity production lines for high-end OmniMechs like the Linebacker, Shaw ordered that one line be retooled to produce the Sojourner instead. Shaw's decision was a pragmatic realization of her Clan's weakened position, with the easy to repair, easy to pilot and low-cost design appealing to her greatly. While widely deployed in the much depleted clusters of the Exiles Wolves, as per agreements with the Lyran Commonwealth production of the Sojourner was also shared with the Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces. Though the Exiles largely distribute them to their greenest warriors, the LCAF primarily assigns them to more seasoned troops who can make best advantage of Clan-grade weaponry. For both factions, the value of the Sojourner in an era of increasingly prolonged warfare and limited resources in both men as well as material has been amply proven.
