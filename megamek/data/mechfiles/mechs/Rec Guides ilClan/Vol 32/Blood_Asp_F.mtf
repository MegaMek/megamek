overview:One of the first 'Mechs to field the breakthrough Heavy Laser technology, the Blood Asp proves to be an offensive powerhouse. Delivering incredible damage at all ranges, the Blood Asp makes short work of any enemy regardless of size.

capabilities:Based on the Kingfisher, the Blood Asp adds an XL engine, but space constraints forced the replacement of the Kingfisher's ferro-fibrous armor with standard plate. The Blood Asp incorporates sixteen tons of this armor and fourteen double heat sinks in the base chassis.

deployment:Developed during the Jihad, this configuration is designed for close-quarters combat. The Blood Asp has been given four Streak SRM-6 launchers with three tons of ammunition, and a pair of Medium Pulse Lasers and AP Gauss Rifles for short range combat. For medium and long range, it mounts two ER PPCs and a single Plasma Cannon with a ton ammo. To cope with the heat buildup, the 'Mech has been given an additional five Double Heat Sinks. 

history:Created by Clan Star Adder as an insult to their enemies, Clan Blood Spirit, the Blood Asp has a large amount of available pod space for its size.
