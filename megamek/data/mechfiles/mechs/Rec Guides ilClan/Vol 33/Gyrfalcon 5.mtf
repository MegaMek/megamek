overview:The Gyrfalcon, a successor to Olivetti Weaponry’s Eyrie, was unveiled by the Jade Falcons twenty-five years after the Eyrie's introduction. Developed as part of a Clan Council initiative to rejuvenate the touman during Devlin Stone’s peace, the Gyrfalcon was designed to inspire both the new generation and veteran warriors of the Jade Falcons. It embodies the Clan’s principles of pride, patriotism, and culture, proving to be a resounding success in both its battlefield role and as a symbol of Clan identity.
capabilities:The Gyrfalcon stands out for its maneuverability and offensive pressure, thanks to its MASC system and partial wing assembly. It maintains a balance between keeping adversaries at a distance with its weapons and relying on reflective armor for defense. For close-range engagements, the Gyrfalcon’s legs are reinforced to withstand the rigors of performing Death From Above assaults, making it a formidable opponent in various combat scenarios.
deployment:Aleksandr Hazen’s configuration, with an ER large laser and UAC/5 on each arm, ferro-fibrous armor, and no light active probe.
history:The Gyrfalcon's journey from concept to battlefield dominance is a testament to Clan Jade Falcon's enduring pursuit of excellence in Mech design and combat strategy. Conceived during a period of relative peace, the Gyrfalcon was not just a response to immediate tactical needs but a forward-looking vision aimed at preparing the Clan for future conflicts. Its development paralleled the Clan's aspirations to uphold and enhance their proud warrior culture, with the Mech serving as both a literal and symbolic weapon of Clan Jade Falcon's might.</p>
