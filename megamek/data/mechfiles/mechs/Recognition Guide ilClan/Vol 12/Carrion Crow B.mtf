overview:The Carrion Crow is a Raven Alliance OmniMech designed alongside the heavier and more expensive War Crow.

capabilities:An extralight engine drives the 'Mech at a top speed of 111km/h. Protection for the engine and Endo-Steel chassis is provided by nine and a half tons of Ferro-Lamellor armor. Fourteen and a half tons of pod space allows the Carrion Crow to carry weapons that let it effectively fight heavier units.

deployment:An Improved Heavy Medium Laser is in the right arm, while the left arm carries an ER Large Laser. Supplementing this is an ATM 9 in the left torso, and two tons of ammunition is in the right torso. Also present is an engine Supercharger for sprint speeds, and a Watchdog CEWS is mounted in the center torso to disrupt enemy networks.

history:Deployment of the Carrion Crow is limited to the Raven touman with the Alliance Military Corps not receiving any of these 'Mechs. A fast 'Mech, the Carrion Crow is intended to be a standard medium 'Mech for the Alliance.
