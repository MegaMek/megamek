overview:The Fire Falcon was created in the early-3050s, apparently as a replacement for the Mist Lynx.

deployment:This variant is designed to destroy infantry and battle armored troops. Equipped with an Active Probe to sniff out targets, each side torso carries a Machine Gun Array with four Machine Guns. The arms each carry an ER Micro Laser and ER Small Laser to deal with battle armor. For heavier targets, the Fire Falcon F carries a single ER Large Laser.

capabilities:The Fire Falcon is faster, has more front-facing armor, and more pod space, though it lacks the Jump Jets of that earlier 'Mech. It makes use of weight-saving materials in the form of an XL Engine, an Endo Steel internal structure, and four tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. Clan Jade Falcon first produced this OmniMech on their capital of Ironhold, but they soon began to produce it on the Occupation Zone headquarters of Sudeten. In November of 3069, Clan Steel Viper would sack Ironhold as part that Clan's effort to expel the Jade Falcons from the Clan Homeworlds. The invasion would end up destroying the Fire Falcon's production facilities, letting the design fade from use by Homeworlds based Clans.
