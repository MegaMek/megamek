overview:The Bane is a BattleMech that is based upon a Star League prototype that was never put into production. Tagged the Kraken by Inner Sphere forces who opposed it.

capabilities:The Bane was first built in 2827. It was originally a significant part of many Clan toumans, but was gradually relegated to second-line status following the introduction of the OmniMech. As such, it is still critical to many defensive units. The design uses a lightweight XL Engine so that it can mount the arsenal that it does. Nineteen tons of armor protects this venerable assault 'Mech.

deployment:This Dark Age version uses an Endo Composite structure to free weight. Each arm carries a pair of Rotary AC/2 autocannon. The left and right torso each carry an LRM-10; The right torso also carries an ER Large Laser. Each side torso has a ton of LRM ammo and three tons of Rotary AC ammunition in a CASE II protected bay. Seventeen double heat sinks are fitted, and a head mounted ECM Suite interferes with targeting systems.
