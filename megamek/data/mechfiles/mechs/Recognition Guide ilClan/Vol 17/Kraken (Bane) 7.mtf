overview:The Bane is a BattleMech that is based upon a Star League prototype that was never put into production. Tagged the Kraken by Inner Sphere forces who opposed it.

capabilities:The Bane was first built in 2827. It was originally a significant part of many Clan toumans, but was gradually relegated to second-line status following the introduction of the OmniMech. As such, it is still critical to many defensive units. The design uses a lightweight XL Engine so that it can mount the arsenal that it does. Nineteen tons of armor protects this venerable assault 'Mech.

deployment:Derived from the Bane 6, each arm has a HAG/40. The right torso carries a Large Pulse Laser and four ER Medium Lasers. Eight tons of HAG ammo is in the left torso, while the right torso carries four more tons of HAG ammo. No ECM suite is fitted, but fourteen double heat sinks are carried.
