overview:This fast second-line striker BattleMech is still a fast light that is now capable of delivering plenty of short-range missiles.

capabilities:To achieve this, it uses an XL Engine, Endo Steel structure, and mounts only three and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. It also carries enough jump jets to leap up to 210 meters at a time. This results in an expensive garrison 'Mech, but one that is still in production nonetheless. Unique among the IIC models, the Jenner IIC changes the leg mechanism found on the original design. While the original Jenner, despite otherwise sharing design characteristics common in Marauder-descended reverse articulated 'Mechs, had standard forward articulated legs, the IIC model has reverse articulated legs similar to those on the Stormcrow.

deployment:This variant mimics the original Jenner by carrying four Small Pulse Lasers. These are devastating to infantry, but still respectable against other units. A Narc Missile Beacon allows it to aid the targeting of other units' missiles.

history:The Jenner was first fielded in September 2784, the same year the Exodus fleet that would eventually become the Clans left the Inner Sphere in November. How exactly they acquired this design in that short timeframe is not known, but what is known is that the Clan version fields Clan weaponry, so it is known as the Jenner IIC.
