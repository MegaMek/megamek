overview:The Templar III is a Dark Age era Assault Class OmniMech, first produced by General Motors for the Federated Suns. It was intended as a replacement for the original Templar, whose factory lines were destroyed during the Jihad. General Motors established a new production line on New Valencia for what was to become the next generation of the Templar with newer technologies.

capabilities:Like its predecessor, the Templar III is typically utilized as a Command 'Mech by AFFS forces. With its alternate configurations the 'Mech is able to handle various combat situations thanks to access to Advanced equipment.

deployment:Julian Davion piloted a custom Templar III with a weapon loadout similar to the Prime configuration, but upgraded to feature a full suite of Clan-tech weaponry: an ER PPC and ER medium laser in each arm, an ER Small Laser and Streak SRM-6 in the torso, and a Targeting Computer. Thanks to the resulting weight savings, four extra double heat sinks help keep the energy-intensive arsenal firing. 

history:Among the most noticeable differences when comparing the original Templar to the Templar III is its smaller Pod Capacity. The new 'Mech has a 29 ton Pod capacity in comparison to the old Templar's 40 tons. However, the 'Mech's heavier Light Engine provides improved durability while retaining the original design's maximum speed and armor protection.
