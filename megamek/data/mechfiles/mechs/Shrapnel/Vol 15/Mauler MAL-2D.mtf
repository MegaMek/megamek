history:<p>The Mauler's history intertwines with the evolutionary currents of mech warfare, reflecting the shifting tides of technological advancements and strategic demands. Originating from the Daboku, a product of the ambitious Project Daboku, the Mauler's early days were marred by operational challenges. Despite these initial setbacks, the Mech's potential was undeniable, prompting Luthien Armor Works to refine and revitalize the design. In the late 3040s, the Mauler emerged as a distinct entity, shedding the stigma of the Daboku and embodying a new era of mechanized warfare. This transformation was not just in name but in capability, as the Mauler incorporated state-of-the-art technologies, evolving beyond its predecessor's limitations.</p><p>
