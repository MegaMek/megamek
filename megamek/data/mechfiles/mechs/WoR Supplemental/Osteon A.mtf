overview:The Osteon was The Society's assault-class OmniMech. To maximize the 'Mech's battlefield longevity, the designers focused on survivability above other considerations. Eighteen tons of Ferro-Lamellor armor provide excellent protection against weapons fire, but in case the armor is breached the Reinforced Structure will resist most attacks. In addition, the Torso-Mounted Cockpit allows the Osteon's pilot to take advantage of the heavy center torso armor. To maximize the Osteon's damage potential, a Nova CEWS allows the unit to share targeting data with friendly units. This equipment is so valuable that it's permanently mounted in the 'Mech's head.

capabilities:The Osteon-A uses a trio of Mech Mortar/8s to lay down suppressing fire against conventional infantry, Battle Armor, ProtoMechs, and other light 'Mechs. Six tons of mortar ammunition provide an ample supply for a battle, but the lack of CASE or CASE II protection may concern some warriors. To augment this long range power, the 'Mech carries a single ER Large Laser in the left torso. For close in work, the Osteon-A carries a Medium Pulse Laser in the right torso, and each arm carries a pair of Improved Heavy Medium Lasers. To dissipate the additional heat from these weapons, the 'Mech carries a total of fourteen Double Heat Sinks. 

deployment:Due to the role this Omnimech played with The Society during the Wars of Reaving, the Osteon, as of 3090, was outlawed by the Home Clans, although it was undergoing study.
