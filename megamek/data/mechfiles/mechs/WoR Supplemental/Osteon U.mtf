overview:The Osteon was The Society's assault-class OmniMech. To maximize the 'Mech's battlefield longevity, the designers focused on survivability above other considerations. Eighteen tons of Ferro-Lamellor armor provide excellent protection against weapons fire, but in case the armor is breached the Reinforced Structure will resist most attacks. In addition, the Torso-Mounted Cockpit allows the Osteon's pilot to take advantage of the heavy center torso armor. To maximize the Osteon's damage potential, a Nova CEWS allows the unit to share targeting data with friendly units. This equipment is so valuable that it's permanently mounted in the 'Mech's head.

capabilities:This variant is intended for underwater combat. Equipped with two Underwater Maneuvering Units for mobility beneath the waves and a BattleMech HarJel System for protection against hull breaches. The Osteon-U carries a quartet of LRT-15's paired with Artemis V Fire Control Systems to combat other subsurface threats. Nine tons of ammunition means that the Osteon-U will be able to stay in the fight for a long time. 

deployment:Due to the role this Omnimech played with The Society during the Wars of Reaving, the Osteon, as of 3090, was outlawed by the Home Clans, although it was undergoing study.
