overview:The Savage Coyote OmniMech was created as a showcase OmniMech. The 'Mech was also part of Khan Koga's attempts to revitalize the fading Clan that invented the OmniMech.

capabilities:This assault 'Mech uses an XL Engine to save enough weight to devote forty-five tons of space to modular equipment and fifteen tons of armor. The base chassis contains fourteen fixed double heat sinks.

deployment:Developed by The Society this Savage Coyote mounts a Nova CEWS system, an iATM 12 in the side torsos, a HAG 30 in the left arm, while the right arm carries a pair of ER Medium Lasers and a single ER Large Pulse Laser. These experimental systems provide the Savage Coyote Z pilot with a chance to destroy better trained Clan pilots.

history:Following the development of Advanced Tactical Missile technology. The creation of the Savage Coyote was a direct result of both the warriors of Clan Coyote clamoring for new weapons to use and the election of Khan Sullivan Koga in 3052.
