overview:The Grigori is one of the Word of Blake's new Celestial series OmniMechs designed by Doctor Devon Cortland.

capabilities:It is constructed on a standard chassis, but makes use of eleven tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor, a light fusion engine, and an XL Gyro; as well as the small cockpit that is common to all of the Celestials. Like the other Celestials, the Grigori has a C3i Computer to help direct its fire.

deployment:Based on the Infernus, the custom config of Opacus Venatori member Rufus Black Bear retains the paired Artemis enhanced Independence 9SL MML 7s and rear facing Diverse Optics ER Small Laser but swaps the Plasma Rifle and Medium Pulse Laser for a Kinslaughter-4 Light PPC with a C4 PPC Capacitor and a Ramtech 5500V Medium Variable Speed Pulse Laser, replacing the Plasma ammo with an extra ton of missile reloads.

history:The Grigori (named after fallen angels from Christianity) was added to the Word of Blake Militia's arsenal in late 3069 as Doctor Cortland oversaw the final production personally.
