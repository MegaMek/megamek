overview:The Lightray was designed by Martinson Armaments to be a heavy scout 'Mech and was put into production in 3064.

capabilities:The Lightray is built on a lightweight Geometric 33B Endo Steel chassis to help maximize the available weight for weapons and equipment and features a gigantic LTV 385 XL engine, the largest that can possibly be carried by a 'Mech its size. The engine allows the scout 'Mech to outpace most other medium designs with a top speed of 118 kilometers per hour, though it lacks the added maneuverability that could be provided by jump jets. The Lightray carries ten and a half tons of Strasbourg Armaments Type 4 Ferro-Fibrous armor, giving the 'Mech a great deal of protection.

deployment:A simple upgrade to the Lightray to enable it to mount the C3i system commonly found in Word of Blake units, the 6W is armed with an ER PPC supported by three ER Medium Lasers.
