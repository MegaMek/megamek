overview:The light assault 'Mech of the Celestial series of OmniMechs, the Seraph is somewhat slow for its weight, but it attempts to make up for that with the inclusion of Triple-Strength Myomer that enables the 'Mech to speed up to 64 kph when it runs hot.

capabilities:Like the other Celestials, the Seraph makes use of a light fusion engine and a small cockpit, though other newer technologies are present only in its weaponry. As with the other Celestials, a C3i Computer is included. The main criticism of the Seraph Invictus is that it does not make very good use of its Triple-Strength Myomer. The design does not build enough heat to activate the musculature, a problem the Streak missile system only exacerbates.

deployment:Based on the Infernus, the custom config of Opacus Venatori member Adept Havalah Cazer carries a Brandt DragonMaw Ultra AC/20 supplied with a whopping six tons of reloads supported by a Ramtech 9500V Large and 5500V Medium Variable Speed Pulse Laser. While a Targeting Computer ensures she hits what she targets, a Brandt Whipsaw Anti-Missile System wards off missile fire for as long as it single ton of reloads lasts.
