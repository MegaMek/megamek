overview:Originally developed in the final year of the Amaris Civil War as the ultimate fixed position city defense BattleMech.

capabilities:The Annihilator is armed with an arsenal that is built to instill fear in an enemy as much as damage them.  The 100-ton 'Mech has a maximum speed of 32.4 km/h, making it one of the slowest 'Mechs ever designed together with the UrbanMech. It is by no means intended to use speed to outmaneuver an enemy, instead depending on its twelve and a half tons of armor to weather any fire that is directed at the 'Mech.

deployment:Developed by the Arc-Royal MechWorks, the Annihilator-2AX used nineteen tons of Laser Reflective Armor as protection. It also used several Armored Components to increase battlefield longevity (Sensors, Life Support, and Cockpit). The traditional weapons have been removed and replaced by a pair of Improved Heavy Gauss Rifles. CASE was installed in each torso to protect against Gauss rifle explosion. The ammunition for the Gauss rifles was located in the Annihilator's arms. 

history:The Annihilator was built as a sign of the military strength of both the Star League in Exile and the newly created Clans. Discontinued before the Clans' Golden Century, in one of their few missteps, the Wolf's Dragoons brought a number of unknown designs with them in 3009, raising more questions to their origins while at the same time adding to their mystique. It was exclusive to the Dragoons until the Jihad disseminated the design to Arc-Royal due to the strengthening of the relationship that Wolf's Dragoons forged with the Kell Hounds and Clan Wolf-in-Exile following their flight from Outreach.
