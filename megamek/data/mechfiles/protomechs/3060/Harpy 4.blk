<capabilities>
The only real advantage it offered over the battle armor was the top speed and size. Because of this it was quickly relegated to anti-infantry work. As a proof of concept however, the Harpy did demonstrate that the ProtoMech (with improvements) could become a viable weapon. After the destruction of Clan Smoke Jaguar, initially just Clan Hell's Horses and Clan Star Adder adopted the Harpy for their use, joined later by Clan Jade Falcon and Clan Fire Mandrill. Capable of jumping 90 meters at a time and can maintain a cruising speed of 32 km/h, adequate for hunting down infantry. Its light armoring - a single shot from a medium laser will punch through the center torso - is also sufficient for resisting most infantry-scale weapons, while its size can be intimidating to most troopers.

<overview>
The Harpy was the first ProtoMech ever created. Intended as a "proof-of-concept" more than an actual fighting unit, the Harpy doesn't outperform a standard Elemental battle armor suit in most categories.

<deployment>
Similar version to the Harpy 3, this fourth version of the Harpy retains its earlier version's weapon, while designers reduced its top speed to 50 km/h. It regained its jump jets and added MASC equipment to give its brief speed boost. Armor protection was also reconfigured for the design.

<history>
Clan Smoke Jaguar struggled following the Battle of Tukayyid. Guerrilla attacks and uprisings in their Inner Sphere occupation zone had depleted supplies. Smoke Jaguar scientists discovered that their Clan worlds might soon lose BattleMech ores if nothing was done. The Clan's greatest scientists developed a revolutionary warfare unit that combined BattleMechs and Elemental Battle Armor. The smaller units would weigh one-tenth of BattleMechs and be half their height. With their smaller engines, the Smoke Jaguars could produce more of them for less material. ProtoMechs were designed to make a Point of five work as well as a BattleMech while using half the construction resources. Smoke Jaguar geneticists also started breeding pilots. To fit in a ProtoMech's torso, this new breed would need to be smaller than Elementals. Smoke Jaguar scientists and geneticists began working on ProtoMechs in secret, knowing that their Khans would not consider full-scale manufacturing unless they were proven useful in battle. Smoke Jaguar Khan Lincoln Osis discovered ProtoMechs during the Battle of Huntress. His Clan's dire requirements and the ProtoMechs' good performance against desperate odds mitigated his indignation at being uninformed about the secret endeavor. The Clans couldn't ignore the ProtoMech's premiere, even though the war was lost. After the Great Refusal and the demise of the Smoke Jaguars, numerous Clans raided Huntress to steal its technology. Clan Coyote and Clan Blood Spirit were the first to adopt the ProtoMech and enthusiastically develop it, especially the Spirits, who were resource-poor. Huntress salvaged ProtoMechs for most Clans. The Blood Spirits started a formal training program first. The Inner Sphere was uninterested in ProtoMech development. The machine needed Somebody to control it, and even if it could be reproduced, the moral and ethical issues would hinder broad use. Inner Sphere scientists also lacked the technological ability to reproduce ProtoMech's distinctive internal structure, armoring, and heat sinks, which would have resulted in bigger, less-effective units.
