<capabilities>
Weighing more than any other ProtoMech, it trades speed for armor and weaponry. Intended for defensive operations, the Minotaur's lack of speed isn't an obstacle to completing its mission, and its impressive firepower means an entire Point working together can quickly take down a single target. The drawback to this power however is a slow cruising speed of 32 km/h, which is somewhat compensated by a jumping capacity of 90 meters thanks to its Jump Jets.
</capabilities>

<overview>
The Minotaur is the "assault class" of the first generation ProtoMechs. 
</overview>

<deployment>
Developed by The Society, this variant of the Minotaur uses five Extended Jump Jets and a Magnetic Clamp system to travel around the battlefield. It's equipped with an Improved Heavy Medium Laser, making it a threat to many units.
</deployment>

<history>
One of the first ProtoMech's Task Force Serpent encounter in it's attack on Huntress. After the fall of Clan Smoke Jaguar the Minotaur was quickly adopted by Clans Goliath Scorpion, Hell's Horses and Star Adder before spreading to many other Clans in the following decades.
