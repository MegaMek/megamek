overview:"I've never seen anything like this, Commander. This 'Mech oozes deadly grace and can obviously devastate anything in its path. It's... otherworldly, but clearly influenced by Star League 'tech. It has a mounted artillery piece to boot - I wonder where it came from." - Yang Virtanen
deployment:The Bull Shark is a 95-ton Assault 'Mech described as a "Heavy Brawler", and is equipped to engage targets across a fairly wide range bracket with its somewhat unusual arsenal. Some of its long-range firepower comes from a Thumper Artillery Cannon that takes up most of the right torso. This is backed up by two extended range medium lasers in each torso, while each arm mounts an LB 10-X AC and an Ultra AC/5. The design features two tons of LB 10-X ammo and four tons of Ultra AC/5 ammo. Thirteen Double Heat Sinks (two in the left torso plus eleven in the engine) attempt to keep the very high heat generation of its ER medium lasers in check.
history:Following the discovery and subsequent loss of the original Bull Shark BSK-MAZ aboard the abandoned jumpship Dobrev, the shadowy organisation known as the Baumann Group set to recreate the design. While the original 'Mech was lost to them during a conflict with the Black Widow Company, a large equipment cache of mysterious origin was still aboard and available for them to use, primarily consisting of seemingly cast-off but high-quality autocannons. After a few years of design and production set-up, the initial results were less than desirable, with the 'Mech unable to match its original's speed without sacrificing firepower or armour. The rediscovery of Endo-Steel and Extralight Fusion Engine manufacturing in 3035, around a decade after the original Bull Shark had been lost, allowed the Baumann Group to progess their recreation further. With their influence and black market dealings, they sourced the new material and engines for their efforts. Using standard Inner Sphere weaponry - paired with the Improved Autocannons from the Dobrev - a limited run of BSK-M3s were produced and sold to those with the right connections and enough C-Bills to afford the exotic-looking new 'Mechs.                                   Implied to be a Clan Wolverine design, which would explain why Natasha Kerensky was trying to destroy it.

notes:HBS standard armour scheme comes to          LA 28 -- LTF 31 LTB 9 -- CTF 40 CTB 11 -- RTF 31 RTB 9 -- RA 28 -- LL 26 -- RL 26.          Thumper Cannon may be treated as preloaded with two shots, and only two shots. Optionally remove Thumper ammo bin and replace with LB 10-X ammo, otherwise add 4 points armour to each arm and leg.          Thumper Cannon may use an updated damage profile of 15/5A if agreed upon. Suggest following the above note of preloaded ammo.          Clan Wolverine was Annihilated in 2823. ER Med. Laser (C) available in 2824.          UAC/5 (C) available in 2825.          LB 10-X (C) available in 2828.          UAC/5 (C) used because frankly the design mandates it. Assume it was somehow sourced by survivors.          Since ER Med. Lasers were available the year before, assume they were sourced as well. If you wish to use prototype ER lasers, the stats for those are identical to ER Med. (IS) but weighing 1.5 tons each. Remove the Thumper ammo bin and one ton of armour.          LB 10-X (C) assumed to be too late to source, and relic LB 10-X (IS) are mounted instead; also to enforce the mixed tech nature of the 'mech and follow the weight layout.
