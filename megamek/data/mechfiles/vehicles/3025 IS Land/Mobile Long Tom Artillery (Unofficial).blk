<capabilities>
The main unit was a 65-ton tracked vehicle and the only one in the convoy that possessed an, admittedly meager, engine capable of only 25.6 km/h and requiring constant refueling. This piloting cab also served as the targeting center, featuring an additional ton of communication equipment and the mounted weaponry. However the vehicle was protected by a scant four tons of armor, though it was not supposed to be anywhere near combat. For this reason the Long Tom relied on defensive units for anti-air support. Included in the artillery system was a variety support carriages. The purpose of these was to carry support personnel who directed the fire of the Long Tom.

<overview>
**THIS IS THE UNOFFICIAL VERSION COMBINING ALL THE TRAILERS INTO ONE UNITS**  The Mobile Long Tom was essentially an artillery piece on wheels. Known in official Star League records as the LT-MOB-25, it is actually six vehicles all hooked together as part of a massive convoy.
</overview>

<deployment>
An Armstrong Industries Long Tom Rifle Mobile Chassis System. The artillery piece was capable of extremely long range fire more suited to demolishing defensive fortifications than firing into a firefight. The only short-range weapons were four, side-mounted Sperry Browning Machine Guns that were more suited to anti-infantry than anti-'Mech duty.

<history>
This combat vehicle was first produced for the Star League Defense Force and the design soon became common in the every military throughout the Inner Sphere and Periphery.
