<deployment>
The vehicle's primary weaponry is its three long-range Class 2 Autocannons. The ZeusBolt ACs have been given 5 tons of ammunition to snipe targets at distance. For close-in defense, the vehicle was given a pair of Marklin Mini Missile SRM 2 Packs with a ton of ammunition. The vehicle was given 9 tons of StarSlab/9 Armor to protect its hull from damage. Its engine is capable of accelerating the Pike to 54 km/h.
</deployment>

<history>
The Pike was created at the direction of Magestrix Kyalla Centrella of the Magistracy of Canopus during the later part of the Third Succession War. Her plan was to produce an inexpensive combat vehicle so the Great Houses would wear down their BattleMech armies through attrition, and the Pike would be the tool she envisioned for the task. However, sending vehicles to market in the Inner Sphere was to be more costly than anticipated. With the Great Houses' shrinking numbers of ships in their JumpShip fleets, the vehicle did not make the impact she had hoped it would. It became a favorite of ComStar's growing garrison forces for their HPG complexes.
