<capabilities>
The aircraft itself is a standard rotary wing design. The two counter-rotating rotor systems negate the need for a tail rotor, as there is no drive torque to be canceled. Capable of speeds of 162 km/h, the Warrior can range across the battlefield with ease, Weapons are mated to an N&D Handsfree targeting and tracking system linked to the pilot's helmet, allowing the pilot to merely look at what he wants to target and pull the trigger. One ton of reloads each give the helicopter decent endurance in combat.

<overview>
First produced in 2950, the Warrior H-7 attack helicopter is a common sight across the Inner Sphere, serving as a highly mobile fire support unit.
</overview>

<deployment>
The Warrior is designed around a center line-mounted SarLon Autocannon/2. While not as powerful as some autocannons, the extremely long range of the weapon allows the Warrior to engage targets from outside of the effective range of most opponents, slowly wearing down their armor. To provide close-in protection against targets that cannot be effectively engaged within the minimum range of the SarLon, the Warrior mounts a TharHes SRM-4 rack.
</deployment>

<history>
Privately designed by Lockheed-CBM as a cheaper and more easily produced substitute for light BattleMechs in the notoriously top-heavy and sluggish Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces' Third Succession Warâ€“era BattleMech regiments, the Lyran High Command originally dismissed the Warrior as a worthless "flying toy" in 2957 until the Ninth Battle of Hesperus that same year damaged Defiance Industries' facilities to the point the LCAF were desperate for any military hardware, placing heavy orders and ensuring continued production since.
