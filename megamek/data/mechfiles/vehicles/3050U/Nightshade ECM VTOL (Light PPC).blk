<capabilities>
The first craft to carry the system, the Nightshade was highly unpopular with pilots due to the inadequate two tons of FiberTech Light armor and single weapon it carried, necessary costs for its high speed and the weight of the Guardian suite.
</capabilities>

<overview>
The Nightshade is a light VTOL designed in 2597 specifically to provide an aerial platform for the Guardian ECM Suite.
</overview>

<deployment>
Contracted by the Word of Blake to investigate updated versions of numerous classic SLDF designs, the Terran based Meers-Skobel Defense Corporation's version is slightly slower but carries a more useful equipment and weapons load. Clad in two and half tons of FiberTech Light Plus Ferro-Fibrous armor, the modern Nightshade retains the Guardian ECM but adds a C3i Computer, carrying a single Moscovia Light PPC for protection
</deployment>

<history>
With the Guardian entering the realms of LosTech and the destruction of Yelm's main factory by a Lyran Commonwealth orbital bombardment in the early Succession Wars, the VTOL was relegated to second line militias and warehouses such as ComStar's Terran stockpiles. Production of the design was finally revived by the Word of Blake, with modern technology giving it an expanded role in the Blakists' Protectorate Militia during the Jihad.
