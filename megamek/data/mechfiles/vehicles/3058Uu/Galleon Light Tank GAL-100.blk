</capabilities>

<overview>
A light combat vehicle that first saw production in 2692] the Galleon proved to be an economical means of supporting infantry and BattleMechs.
</overview>

<deployment>
The Galleon is armed with a single Jackson Model 17 medium laser and a pair of Model 12 Small Lasers. These weapons provide decent firepower for its weight class, enabling the Galleon to worry contemporary 'Mechs of the same tonnage as itself.
</deployment>

<history>
Despite this, the vehicle served well during the Amaris Civil War, and after the Exodus, these tracked vehicles mostly fell into the possession of the Draconis Combine and the Free Worlds League. The Galleon is often paired with the Harasser Missile Platform.
