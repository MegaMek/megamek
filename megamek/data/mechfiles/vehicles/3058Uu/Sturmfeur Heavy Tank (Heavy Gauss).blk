<overview>
True to the philosophy of the LCAF that commissioned it, the SturmFeur is slow and can withstand a determined counter-assault before needing to withdraw, thanks to its copious armor protection.

<deployment>
Produced by Defiance Industries when the Word of Blake held Hesperus II, this version of the SturmFeur was equipped with a Light Fusion Engine. The weapons were removed and replaced by a forward firing LRM-20 with Artemis IV fire control system. A single B-Pod was attached to every side of the hull, protecting the SturmFeur from infantry attacks. The body also housed the Improved C3 Computer common to Word of Blake units. The turret carried a single TAG system, two ER Medium Lasers, and a pair of MML-9s with Artemis IV FCS. The LRM-20 had a ton of ammunition, and the MML-9s had a ton each of SRM and LRM ammunition.
