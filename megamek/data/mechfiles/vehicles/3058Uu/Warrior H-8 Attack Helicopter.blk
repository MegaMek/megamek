<capabilities>
The aircraft itself is a standard rotary wing design. The two counter-rotating rotor systems negate the need for a tail rotor, as there is no drive torque to be canceled. Capable of speeds of 162 km/h, the Warrior can range across the battlefield with ease, Weapons are mated to an N&D Handsfree targeting and tracking system linked to the pilot's helmet, allowing the pilot to merely look at what he wants to target and pull the trigger. One ton of reloads each give the helicopter decent endurance in combat.
</capabilities>

<overview>
First produced in 2950, the Warrior H-7 attack helicopter is a common sight across the Inner Sphere, serving as a highly mobile fire support unit.
</overview>

<deployment>
First proposed in July 3048, the H-8 upgrade uses recovered technology to enhance the Warrior's performance. The main change is replacing the old ICE with a lighter Lockheed 105 Micro Fusion engine, with the autocannon replaced by a Longfire V LRM-5 and two Hovertec Streak SRM-2 launchers in place of the older SRM-4. The Xilex-2000 comsys is replaced by the Xilex-2010 model. Protection is improved with a switch to ferro-fibrous plating, originally Kallon Unity Weave sourced from the Kallon Industries facility in the Wernke system, but after the breakup of the Federated Commonwealth Lockheed was forced to substitute the original inferior armor until securing local supplies from Lexington Limited after the FedCom Civil War.

<history>
Privately designed by Lockheed-CBM as a cheaper and more easily produced substitute for light BattleMechs in the notoriously top-heavy and sluggish Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces' Third Succession Warâ€“era BattleMech regiments, the Lyran High Command originally dismissed the Warrior as a worthless "flying toy" in 2957 until the Ninth Battle of Hesperus that same year damaged Defiance Industries' facilities to the point the LCAF were desperate for any military hardware, placing heavy orders and ensuring continued production since.
