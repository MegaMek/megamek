This is a Jihad era variant of the tank, which includes Advanced Technology. The tank's signature autocannons have been replaced by a pair of Thunderbolt 20 Missile Launchers mounted in its turret. The T-Bolt launchers have been given 10 tons of ammunition. For secondary weaponry, it has been given a Streak SRM-6 Missile Launcher and a pair of ER Medium Lasers which are mounted in the vehicle's turret. A ton of ammunition has been given to the Streak SRM launcher. The tank's armor has also been greatly increased to handle the rigors of combat. To make room for the revised weaponry and armor, the tank been fitted with an XL fusion engine.
