<capabilities>
The Ajax follows on the heels of the successful Manteuffel OmniVehicle. The Ajax is slow, only capable of attaining speeds up to 54 km/h. Since speed is not its defense, the designers gave the Ajax nineteen tons of armor. The room for all of this armor comes from the XL engine the Ajax uses for power.
</capabilities>

<overview>
The Ajax Assault Tank is an Omni-capable combat vehicle that is the followup to GM's Challenger X MBT.
</overview>

<deployment>
This 3068 configuration carries a Targeting Computer mated to a turret-mounted PPC. A single Streak SRM-6 is also in the turret, while three more Streak SRM-6 systems are mounted on the front of the tank. Additional firepower comes from a bow-mounted MRM-40 launcher. A Guardian ECM suite interrupts Jihad era electronics systems.

<history>
Following the success of a series of new vehicle designs, particularly the Challenger X, General Motors sought a way to create a follow-up, a product that would capitalise on the AFFC's sudden interest in conventional military vehicles. With the phenomenal success of Star Corps' Manteuffel Attack Tank, creating an OmniVehicle was the obvious solution. The Fifth Davion Guards and Sixth Syrtis Fusiliers RCTs were among the first to receive Kathil models, which they put to good use in their fight against the Eighth FedCom RCT and the Eighth Donegal Guards on New Syrtis. Though the Fifth Davion Guards were officially deactivated after their victory, Leftenant General Seth Varnay led a ragtag force of armoured forces, including a sizable number of Ajaxes, to New Avalon, where their firepower was once again demonstrated. Ajaxes can now be found in almost every surviving armoured unit that fought alongside an RCT during the war.
