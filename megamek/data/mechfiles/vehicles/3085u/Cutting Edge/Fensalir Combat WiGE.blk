</overview>

<deployment>
The Fensalir's main weapon is its Defiance Hammerfist Heavy Gauss Rifle, which has been allotted three tons of ammunition. The vehicle's other weapons include a pair of nose-mounted Extended Range Medium Lasers and two 7-tubed Multi-Missile Launchers. The vehicle has two tons of missile ammunition located in the main body.

<history>
The Fensalir was first produced at Nashan's plant on Furillo in 3084, while Johnston - still rebuilding its own manufacturing facilities - shipped components to assemble the WiGEs. When it was first produced, the vehicle initially entered service with the newly-renamed Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces and later being copied by Clan Wolf-in-Exile for their own use.
