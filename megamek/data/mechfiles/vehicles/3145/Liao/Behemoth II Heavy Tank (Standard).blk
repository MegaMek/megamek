<history>
The Behemoth II Heavy Tank designed in 3102, which was a vehicle utilized by military forces in the 3100s. The company would end up gifting vehicles to reluctant military commands between 3108 to 3110 in order to promote the vehicle. The efforts would prove to be successful, Sales suddenly skyrocketed with twice as many tanks being sold than they had gifted away. The tank gained a reputation to be feared among MechWarriors during the Victoria War. Among some noted actions using the vehicle, was in 3117, when elements of the 4th Oriente Hussars encountered a platoon of 4 Behemoth II tanks used to help defend the Capellan world of Shuen Wan during a raid. The Capellan defenders utilized the tank's capacities to hold the high deserts plateau where they encountered the Hussars. The Behemoth IIs proved to be resilient in combat and remained operational throughout the fight, forcing the Hussars to withdraw.
