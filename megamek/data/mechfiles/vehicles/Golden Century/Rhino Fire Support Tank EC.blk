<history>
A testbed for new tech, the Coyotes exchanged the LRM 20s for clan versions while retaining the old LRM 10 launcher. Both medium lasers were upgraded to prototype lasers and a surplus CASE system. Perhaps the most unique addition was a bulldozing unit attached to the chassis before this version of the Rhino was retired from front-line service.
