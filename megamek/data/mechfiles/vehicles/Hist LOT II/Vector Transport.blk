<capabilities>
The primary configuration of the Vector was used for transporting a full infantry platoon. In order to achieve its primary purpose, it sported a nose-mounted Small Pulse Laser which was controlled by the helmet of the pilot and the gunner which allowed for suppressive fire while the two Medium Lasers mounted in the wings allowed for strafing runs against massed targets.

<deployment>
The design also incorporated a fusion engine to power the craft and the energy weapons which would eliminate the need for a fuel source and ammunition dependency.

<history>
It took more than two decades with hundreds of different people being involved and only finally getting realistic specifications laid out by Aleksandr Kerensky. It was finally awarded to General Motors who created a VTOL which could replace other VTOLs in their specific roles with one design which would simplify the replacement parts process. By the middle of the twenty-eight century, over ten thousand Vectors were manufactured allowing every infantry brigade in the SLDF to possess at least one battalion of the VTOL. The Vector proved itself time and time again during the Periphery Uprising and the Amaris Civil War. While the specialized VTOLs were grounded due to not having any spare parts around, the Vectors were able to keep flying due to the cannibalization of parts from other craft. By the end of the twenty-ninth century, all surviving Vectors had been scrapped.
