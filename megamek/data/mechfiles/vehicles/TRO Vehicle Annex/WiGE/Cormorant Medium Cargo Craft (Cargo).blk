<history>
The Cormorant is noted for being the most common WiGE in the FedSuns, produced since the late twenty-seventh century. The WiGE was designed to be used on worlds with large oceans. One of its more notable features, it being inexpensive, due to having no need for airstrips. It was designed with modest protection to fend off natural and human planetary threats to its cargo. The vehicle was typically used on Ulysses, where natural born predators are known for their size and aggression. During the FedCom Civil War many smugglers on Ulysses also became users of the Cormorant to move illegal cargoes. Finally the Ulysses militia purchased several of the craft and used them to drop a battalion of marines on top of the pirates' headquarters. Michaelson's importance to The Republic of the Sphere meant that large numbers of Cormorants and Fulmar patrol craft were found in the RAF.
