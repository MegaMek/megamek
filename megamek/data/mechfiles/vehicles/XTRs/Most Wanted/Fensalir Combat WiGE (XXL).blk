<capabilities>
The Fensalir at the time was the largest Combat WiGE of its kind. It boasted 11.5 tons of Heavy Ferro-Fibrous armor to protect its hull. The vehicle features an Infantry Transport Bay to allow it to deliver up to 4 tons of troops to a hot zone.
</capabilities>

<overview>
The Fensalir Combat WiGE was an attack craft which was built as a joint effort between Johnston Industries and House Steiner based manufacturer Nashan Diversified.
</overview>

<deployment>
This variant was used by pro-Lyran forces in the Republic of the Sphere developed in 3084. It's protected by eleven and a half tons of Heavy Ferro-Fibrous armor, while its main striking power comes from a forward-mounted Improved Heavy Gauss Rifle and a single SRM-6. A Small Pulse Laser covers the rear arc of the vehicle, and two Sponson Turrets each contain a pair of Machine Guns. The Machine Guns and SRM have a ton of ammunition available, while the Improved Heavy Gauss Rifle has a standard three ton ammo bay. An XXL engine is used to maintain the standard Fensalir's speed. The four--ton infantry bay has been replaced by a ten ton cargo bay.
</deployment>

<history>
The Fensalir was first produced at Nashan's plant on Furillo in 3084, while Johnston - still rebuilding its own manufacturing facilities - shipped components to assemble the WiGEs. When it was first produced, the vehicle initially entered service with the newly-renamed Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces and later being copied by Clan Wolf-in-Exile for their own use.
