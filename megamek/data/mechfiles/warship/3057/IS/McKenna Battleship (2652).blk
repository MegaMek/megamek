<capabilities>
The McKenna-class battleship is renowned for its exceptional armament and defensive capabilities. It carries an unprecedented number and variety of weapons, including forty-eight Kreuss PPCs that provide formidable firepower. With an engagement range of 400 kilometers, these powerful weapons can cripple or destroy most WarShips with a single volley. To manage the immense heat generated by its arsenal, the McKenna-class battleship incorporates a complex coolant system with ventral and dorsal fins that increase heat dissipation. This system allows the ship to operate at reduced infrared signature, reducing the likelihood of enemy detection. The battleship also houses eight aerospace fighter squadrons and six DropShips, further augmenting its offensive capabilities.

<overview>
The McKenna-class battleship is an iconic and imposing warship known for its distinctive silhouette, angular turrets, and towering sensor islands. Weighing nearly 2 million tons and measuring 1.5 kilometers in length, it is the largest jump-capable craft built during the Star League era. Serving as the flagship for admirals and highly sought-after assignments for sailors, the McKenna-class battleship boasts unparalleled firepower and a fearsome reputation.

<history>
Introduced in 2652, the McKenna-class battleship quickly earned a reputation as an exceptional combat vessel. Serving on a McKenna-class ship became a highlight of naval careers, signifying prestige and honor. However, during the war to liberate Terra, McKennas became prime targets, resulting in significant losses. Out of the 280 McKenna-class battleships produced in the 130 years before the fall of the Star League, only 29 survived to witness the liberation. Eleven of these vessels were extensively damaged and scuttled. The remaining ships joined the Exodus fleet, with only three observed in service with the Clans. One notable McKenna-class battleship, McKenna's Pride, serves as the flagship of Aleksandr and later Nicholas Kerensky. It is said to maintain a geosynchronous orbit above Strana Mechty, carefully preserved by technicians from all Clans. Rumors suggest that McKenna's Pride is a centerpiece of the Clan Founding Day celebrations, symbolizing their aspiration to capture Terra and establish an ilClan. Until that day comes, the majestic McKenna's Pride continues to watch over Strana Mechty, a testament to the enduring legacy of the McKenna-class battleships.
