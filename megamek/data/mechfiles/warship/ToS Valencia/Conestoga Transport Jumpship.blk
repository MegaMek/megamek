<capabilities>
The Conestoga boasted expansive cargo bays that could accommodate different configurations, ranging from colonist transport to dedicated cargo vessels. It could transport up to 10,000 steerage-class passengers and over 90,000 tons of cargo simultaneously. The vessel featured four large grav decks to provide planetary gravity during short transports. For longer trips and colony startups, the cylindrical design allowed for easy spinning, creating artificial gravity in the cargo bays. Additionally, the Conestoga incorporated weaponry, including large and medium lasers, primarily for meteor defense and anti-boarding measures.
</capabilities>

<overview>
The Conestoga Transport JumpShip, launched by Boeing Interstellar in 2310, was a notable example of early interstellar transport vessels. Based on the Cruiser-class frame and engines, the Conestoga featured a simple design with vast cargo bays that could be easily reconfigured for various purposes. It was renowned for its ruggedness and versatility, capable of transporting large numbers of passengers and substantial amounts of cargo.
</overview>

<history>
As a product of the early Age of War era, the Conestoga served as a representative example of primitive JumpShips built by the Terran Alliance, Terran Hegemony, and other factions. Despite its utility and success in various roles, advancements in production techniques and the introduction of the DropShip/JumpShip combination eventually rendered the Conestoga obsolete. The Reunification War marked the decline of such primitive vessels, as the Periphery states' attempts to employ upgraded versions against the powerful Star League navy proved unsuccessful. By 2600, these early relics of interstellar travel had become nearly extinct, with only occasional derelicts found in orbital junkyards or abandoned in distant Periphery stars. The last remaining Conestogas were scrapped from Nueva Castilian service in 2935, as modern replacements became more readily available.
