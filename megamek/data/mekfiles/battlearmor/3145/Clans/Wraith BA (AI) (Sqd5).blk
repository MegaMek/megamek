<overview>
The Wraith battle armor was designed by the Rasalhague Dominion to support conventional infantry as well as perform surgical strikes.
</overview>

<capabilities>
It is equipped with Basic Stealth armor to hide it from enemy probes, and its jump jets allow it to cover ninety meters in a single jump. The suit was introduced after extensive testing of the Rogue Bear battle armor, and is a direct descendant of that design.
</capabilities>

<deployment>
This variant of the Wraith is protected by Reactive Armor. In place of the two machine guns each arm carries a Firedrake Support Needler. A set of Improved Sensors allows it to find hidden units.
