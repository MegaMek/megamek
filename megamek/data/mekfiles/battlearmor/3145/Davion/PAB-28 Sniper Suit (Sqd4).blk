<overview>
The PAB-28 Sniper Suit wasn't designed for frontline combat, and the designation given to the suit by Federated Industries was intended to be a clear reminder of that fact. 
</overview>

<capabilities>
Lightly armored and slow, the PAB-28 is intended to move into position and wait for targets to present themselves, not to engage enemy units directly or fight in the open; when used within its mission parameters, the PAB-28 proves itself an effective suit, even if it lacks the reputation or appeal of heavier battle armor.
</capabilities>

<deployment>
The PAB-28 mounts two "David" Light Gauss Rifles with twenty rounds of ammunition for each and a pair of Armored Gloves.
</deployment>

<history>
Manufactured in the Federated Industries plant on Novaya Zemlya, the PAB-28 excels in areas where a conventional unarmored sniper would be unable to operate.
