<capabilities>
The Kobold can only jump up to ninety meters at a time, but it does boast enough armor to stop a medium laser. This armor is of the basic stealth variety, making it more difficult to target far away. The Kobold has the distinction of being a battle armor suit used by the Inner Sphere, ComStar, and the Clans.
</capabilities>

<overview>
The Kobold is a battle armor design that was collaborated on by the Free Rasalhague Republic, ComStar, and the second Star League.
</overview>
