<overview>
The PEX-2F Salrilla is an industrial Exoskeleton developed by StarCorps Industries for battlefield salvage details.
</overview>

<capabilities>
The Salrilla retains the Gorilla's body-mounted searchlight and cutting torch and is also protected by 100 kilograms of standard armor. The exoskeleton's actuators and motors allow it to reach speeds of approximately 30 km/h, allowing the frame to reach its battlefield salvage objectives in a timely manner and evade potential threats.
</capabilities>

<deployment>
While the Salrilla is equipped with Standard and Salvage Arm manipulators, these have modular slots to allow for additional equipment and tools to be changed in and out as needed.
</deployment>

<history>
The suit is based on their successful Gorilla Industrial Suit. The company developed the suit after seeing private concerns try to use the Gorilla as a battlefield salvage unit with less success. StarCorps took strides to improve the Gorilla for the task, with the result being a more heavily armored and speedier machine with a slight hike in cost over the original.
