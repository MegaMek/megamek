<overview>
The Fenrir was, in many ways, the successor to the failed Sloth battle armor design.
</overview>

<capabilities>
Named for the demonic wolf of Germanic myth, the Fenrir was less a traditional battle suit and more a mobile fire support platform. The trooper controlling the suit was situated inside a cramped "cockpit" and piloted the Fenrir like a small walking tank. The single, configurable turret mounted on the suit could accept a wide variety of weapon configurations and the Fenrir's sturdy, powerful legs could propel it to much greater speeds than the Sloth. While the design team initially tried to increase the armor protection on the Fenrir, this was sacrificed to accommodate the increase in firepower. The weak armor protection was considered acceptable given its intended role as a hit-and-run fighter; in true Lyran tradition Fenrir pilots were encouraged to use overwhelming firepower to defeat their enemies before they could exploit this weakness.
</capabilities>

<deployment>
The Fenrir features a dorsal Modular Turret Mount, similar to the configurable mounts found on humanoid battle armor designs, with a 300Â° field of fire. Developed in 3076, this version uses an experimental Battle Armor C3 System to coordinate targeting information. The main armament has been replaced with a pair of Clan-spec LRM-5 launchers equipped with enough ammo to fire two salvos each. It also adds an extra 100kg of armor.

<history>
Following the secession of the Lyran Alliance in 3057, Archon Katherine Steiner-Davion ordered the production of a new battlesuit to better underscore her new realm's independence from the Federated Commonwealth. Thanks to its lack of success and the fact that the Federated Suns half of the Commonwealth never liked it, the Lyran design team had many Sloth battlesuits to work with when development began on 9 November 3057. Identifying the only positive aspect of the Sloth - its stability and capacity to carry tremendous firepower - the team focused their efforts on accentuating these features in its heavier successor. Design and production of the first prototype began on 22 October 3058, with final mass production starting 4 January 3060. The Fenrir had a great effect on the battlefields of the FedCom Civil War against Allied forces. Its interchangeable weapon packages allowed these suits to bring tremendous firepower against a variety of targets. The suits also accounted well for themselves during the Jihad, and achieved legendary status in the ultimately futile defense of Defiance Industries on Hesperus II.
