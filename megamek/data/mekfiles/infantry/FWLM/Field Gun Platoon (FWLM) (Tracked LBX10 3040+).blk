<capabilities>
LBX-class field guns are frequently deployed in the anti-aircraft and anti-vehicle roles due to their improved range and ability to fire cluster munitions. The higher costs compared to conventional autocannon is one of the few things preventing them from becoming the defacto standard.
</capabilities>

<overview>
In response to the formation of the Federated Commonwealth the Free World League introduced it's own advanced infantry armor kit.  It is widely considered the most effective commonly available kit in the Inner Sphere and is in high demand among FWL forces.
