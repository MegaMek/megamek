<capabilities>
Ultra-class field guns have a longer range and higher rate of fire compared with their standard equivalents.  The tradeoffs of higher ammunition consumption and higher cost, with the lack of specialized ammunition, keep them from being highly popular.
</capabilities>

<overview>
In response to the formation of the Federated Commonwealth the Free World League introduced it's own advanced infantry armor kit.  It is widely considered the most effective commonly available kit in the Inner Sphere and is in high demand among FWL forces.
