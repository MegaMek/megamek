<capabilities>
Motorized field guns are light and nimble, making them ideal for supporting air mobile forces such as jump infantry regiments which are otherwise light on firepower. Technically privvy to the development details of rotary autocannon, the FedCom Civil War and it's aftermath kept the Lyrans from fielding substantial numbers until much later.

<overview>
After the removal of historically Lyran systems from the unified Federated Commonwealth, many changes took place to restore and reinforce the Lyran nature of military forces posted there.  Infantry armor production was quickly updated with the first production runs seeing little more than a logo change.  Later production would see more visible changes to resemble the older Lyran style while retaining the protection capabilities of the FedCom model.
