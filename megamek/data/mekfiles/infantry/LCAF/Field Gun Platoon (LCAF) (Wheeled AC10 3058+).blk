Although outclassed by many later versions, older autocannon are still in common use as field guns due to lower operational costs plus a wide range of specialized ammunition.

<overview>
After the removal of historically Lyran systems from the unified Federated Commonwealth, many changes took place to restore and reinforce the Lyran nature of military forces posted there.  Infantry armor production was quickly updated with the first production runs seeing little more than a logo change.  Later production would see more visible changes to resemble the older Lyran style while retaining the protection capabilities of the FedCom model.
