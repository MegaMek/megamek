<capabilities>
The new Lyran state included a host of updates to small arms in addition to the changes to infantry armor.  The newly developed Maxell PL-10 was quickly adopted as a domestic alternative to the range of laser rifles in use across the Federated Commonwealth.

<overview>
After the removal of historically Lyran systems from the unified Federated Commonwealth, many changes took place to restore and reinforce the Lyran nature of military forces posted there.  Infantry armor production was quickly updated with the first production runs seeing little more than a logo change.  Later production would see more visible changes to resemble the older Lyran style while retaining the protection capabilities of the FedCom model.
