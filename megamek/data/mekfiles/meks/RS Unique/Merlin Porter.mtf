overview:The Merlin uses components that are all reliable and readily available, making the Merlin a durable and easy-to-repair 'Mech. 

capabilities:The 'Mech is powered by a Pitban 240 fusion engine that gives it a top speed of 64.8 km/h. The Merlin carries ten and a half tons of armor, which is a respectable amount of protection for its weight. Additionally, the Merlin carries eighteen heat sinks to handle its heavy heat load.

deployment:A uniquely customized Merlin introduced in 3064, which was created by a tech named Porter Romero on the world Armington. He salvaged the 'Mech from a pirate raid during the 3060s. Using a wrecked militia Bulldog for parts, he replaced the ruined PPC and LRM-5 with the tank's Large Laser and SRM 4 Launcher as well as adding additional armor.

history:The Merlin debuted in 3010 as a product of the rebuilt Mountain Wolf BattleMechs. The Merlin was hailed as a technological marvel at the time it was released, as it was the first completely new design to be developed in over 100 years.
