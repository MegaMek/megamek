overview:Introduced before the Blackout, the Loki Mk II has become prevalent within the Clans, particularly the Jade Falcon and Hell’s Horses toumans. It represents an evolution in Clan warfare, balancing firepower, armor, and versatility.
capabilities:The Loki Mk II trades some of the original Loki’s speed for an impressive forty tons of pod space and significantly increased armor. This design shift allows for a variety of configurations, each suited to different combat roles. The primary configuration is tailored for long-range engagement, while the A configuration offers a balanced mix of anti-armor and anti-personnel weaponry, suitable for operations away from supply lines. The B configuration provides heavy fire support, though its specialization comes at the cost of reduced defensive capabilities.
deployment:No information on this variant
history:The Loki Mk II's combat history is marked by notable deployments and engagements. In July 3142, the Ninth Falcon Talon Cluster of the Jade Falcons used it in a bombardment campaign on Sargasso. The robustness of the Mk II’s armor was proven when Star Captain Henry’s unit survived a rockslide triggered during combat with the Wolves-in-Exile. Despite losing their Long Toms, the Mk IIs played a crucial role in thwarting the recapture of the world.
