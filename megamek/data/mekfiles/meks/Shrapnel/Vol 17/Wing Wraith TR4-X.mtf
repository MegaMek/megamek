overview:The Wraith is a 'Mech that, when properly employed, can wreak havoc on an enemy with its astounding speed and maneuverability. Initially developed by Curtiss Militech, it later became a key asset for the Capellan Confederation following the company's financial distress post-Jihad. The Wraith's speed, firepower, and decent armor make it a considerable threat to many 'Mechs, some being almost twice its weight.

capabilities:The “Wing” Wraith enhances the base design’s accurate and ammunition-independent loadout with improved heat dissipation and jump range. Despite the advantages of the partial-wing technology, the TR6 suffers from slower ground speed and a demanding maintenance schedule, making it a less popular export than the more straightforward TR5. However, both variants share parts and construction processes, making continued production a low-cost endeavor.

deployment:The TR4-X prototypes were the first production-ready use of partial-wing technology on the Wraith chassis. Excellent jump capabilities were counterbalanced by deficient firepower. Switching out the massive engine enabled development of the production-grade TR4, which was based on the customized TR2-X arena fighter of the late thirty-first century. The TR4 had a powerful main weapon, but CCAF procurement officials demanded a pulse loadout closer to the original Wraith model, leading Hellespont to the dual solutions of the TR5 and TR6.

history:The Wing Wraith project, spearheaded by Hellespont Industries, dates back to the Capellan Crusades, but it wasn’t until the 3140s that the mass-produced TR6 variant saw production. The Wraith’s assets were acquired by the Capellan Confederation after Curtiss Hydroponics, the original manufacturer, was forced to sell its military holdings to remain solvent following the Jihad. The destruction of Curtiss Militech’s homeworld, Paradise, by the Regulans during the Jihad significantly contributed to the financial distress that led to this sale. Hellespont Industries capitalized on this opportunity, integrating advanced partial-wing technology into the Wraith design to enhance its maneuverability and heat dissipation capabilities.<p>The TR6’s first major combat deployment occurred during the Victoria Rangers’ assault on Victoria in 3144. However, the results were underwhelming due to the Wraiths being reassigned to unsuitable roles, leading to significant damage and operational issues. Despite this setback, the TR6 found its stride during House Davion’s Operation Cerberus. On Narellan, Wraiths from the Second St. Ives Cheveau-Légers conducted effective raiding operations against the Second Davion Auxiliaries, showcasing their capability in hit-and-run tactics alongside Canopian Agroteras. This success spurred increased orders from various factions, including the Sea Foxes and the Magistracy Armed Forces, solidifying the Wing Wraith’s reputation as a valuable raider and scout hunter in the Capellan Confederation's arsenal.</p>
