<capabilities>
The Demolisher is an intimidating machine with two turret-mounted heavy guns. The titanic weapons employ a well-known propellant system that combines two chemicals in suspension to propel a stream of massive shells at the unlucky target. This generated a tremendous amount of heat in older models. As a result, crew members were required to wear special coolant suits because the inside of the tank can become unbearably hot during a sustained firefight. The current model addressed the issue by directing the majority of the ejection gases through the barrels. The Demolisher is a defensive unit that works best in urban environments. The two massive autocannons can easily take down an assault 'Mech when they emerge from hiding. The vehicle's lack of secondary weapons, however, forces it to rely on friendly infantry to screen against enemy light armour and infantry.

<overview>
Tall, squat, and using four treads, the Demolisher has a well-earned, though sometimes exaggerated, reputation as one of the most deadly vehicles on the battlefield. Designed to counteract the increasing scarcity of 'Mechs during the Succession Wars, the Demolisher became popular, especially on worlds where BattleMechs were not available.
</overview>

<deployment>
The Demolisher is armed with two 185mm ChemJet Gun Autocannon/20s, which are enough to make any other unit, 'Mechs included, pause. The relatively short range of the guns means that maneuverable units with long-range weaponry can confound the Demolisher. It utilizes 10 tons of armor for protection, and the internal combustion engine allows for a cruising speed 32.4 km/h. The tank also lacks any form of secondary weapons, which may be detrimental when the massive cannons run dry.
