<capabilities>
With a top speed faster than most 'Mechs, the Galleon was well-armed but lacked protection, carrying only three and a half tons of armor.
</capabilities>

<overview>
A light combat vehicle that first saw production in 2692 the Galleon proved to be an economical means of supporting infantry and BattleMechs.
</overview>

<deployment>
The first of two variants that Vicore Industries produced starting in 3066, the 103 uses an XL engine for power. The tonnage saved goes to a C3i Computer and Guardian ECM Suite. The pulse laser of the 102 is upgraded to an ER medium laser, while the remaining tonnage goes towards more armor.
</deployment>

<history>
Despite this, the vehicle served well during the Amaris Civil War, and after the Exodus, these tracked vehicles mostly fell into the possession of the Draconis Combine and the Free Worlds League. The Galleon is often paired with the Harasser Missile Platform.
