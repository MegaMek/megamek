<capabilities>
The Ajax follows on the heels of the successful Manteuffel OmniVehicle. The Ajax is slow, only capable of attaining speeds up to 54 km/h. Since speed is not its defense, the designers gave the Ajax nineteen tons of armor. The room for all of this armor comes from the XL engine the Ajax uses for power.
</capabilities>

<overview>
The Ajax Assault Tank is an Omni-capable combat vehicle that is the followup to GM's Challenger X MBT.
</overview>

<deployment>
The third 3065 configuration makes the Ajax into a support unit with the inclusion of three LRM-15s that are slaved to an Artemis IV Fire Control System and a PPC. Six tons of ammunition rarely leave the missile launchers out of supply. A C3 computer makes this an effective command vehicle, allowing the Ajax B to coordinate the fire of a lance or company. 
</deployment>

<history>
Following the success of a series of new vehicle designs, particularly the Challenger X, General Motors sought a way to create a follow-up, a product that would capitalise on the AFFC's sudden interest in conventional military vehicles. With the phenomenal success of Star Corps' Manteuffel Attack Tank, creating an OmniVehicle was the obvious solution. The Fifth Davion Guards and Sixth Syrtis Fusiliers RCTs were among the first to receive Kathil models, which they put to good use in their fight against the Eighth FedCom RCT and the Eighth Donegal Guards on New Syrtis. Though the Fifth Davion Guards were officially deactivated after their victory, Leftenant General Seth Varnay led a ragtag force of armoured forces, including a sizable number of Ajaxes, to New Avalon, where their firepower was once again demonstrated. Ajaxes can now be found in almost every surviving armoured unit that fought alongside an RCT during the war.
