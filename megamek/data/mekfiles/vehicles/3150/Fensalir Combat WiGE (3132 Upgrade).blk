<history>
The Fensalir was first produced at Nashan's plant on Furillo in 3084, while Johnston - still rebuilding its own manufacturing facilities - shipped components to assemble the WiGEs. When it was first produced, the vehicle initially entered service with the newly-renamed Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces and later being copied by Clan Wolf-in-Exile for their own use.
