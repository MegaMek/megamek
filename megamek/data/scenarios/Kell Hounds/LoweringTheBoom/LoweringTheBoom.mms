      # Situation
      ## Castor
      ## Free Worlds League
      ## 15 June 3012

      The idea for a Steiner raid on the Marik world of Castor originated with Cranston Snord, a well-known
      eccentric and one of Katrina Steiner's long-serving mercenary commanders. Snord's sources had informed
      him of a priceless collection of Faberg√© Eggs located on Castor, and he already envisioned them as part
      of his private museum on Clinton.

      Upon learning of Snord's plans, Morgan and Patrick Kell saw an opportunity to put their newly formed
      unit to the test in battle. With Lyran intelligence uncovering a cache of illegal atomic weapons on
      Castor, Katrina Steiner sanctioned the raid. The operation aimed to eliminate the weapons, secure the
      eggs for Snord, and provide combat experience for the Kell Hounds.

      Colonel Nage recognized the battle was lost and retreated with his command company, aiming to reach the
      atomic weapons and unleash them on the mercenaries. Colonel Kell dispatched Salome Ward and her
      Relentless Wolves to intercept him. Ward's company caught up with Nage just as he was nearing the depot.
      She launched an attack as the Second Battalion's LAMs bombed the depot.

      ## Decisive Defeat

      Not more than one Marik Mek managed to evade the Kell Hounds forces. The Kell Hounds
      have won a decivise victory.

      Ward's Wolves inflicted significant losses on the Marik Meks. Witnessing the smoke rising
      from the depot and his units sustaining severe damage, Nage decided to flee, with the relentless
      pursuit of the Wolves close behind.
