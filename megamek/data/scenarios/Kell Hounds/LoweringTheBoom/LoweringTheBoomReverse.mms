      # Situation
      ## Castor
      ## Free Worlds League
      ## 7 June 3011

      The idea for a Steiner raid on the Marik world of Castor originated with Cranston Snord, a well-known
      eccentric and one of Katrina Steiner's long-serving mercenary commanders. Snord's sources had informed
      him of a priceless collection of Faberg√© Eggs located on Castor, and he already envisioned them as part
      of his private museum on Clinton.

      Upon learning of Snord's plans, Morgan and Patrick Kell saw an opportunity to put their newly formed
      unit to the test in battle. With Lyran intelligence uncovering a cache of illegal atomic weapons on
      Castor, Katrina Steiner sanctioned the raid. The operation aimed to eliminate the weapons, secure the
      eggs for Snord, and provide combat experience for the Kell Hounds.
      
      Colonel Nage recognized the battle was lost and retreated with his command company, aiming to reach the 
      atomic weapons and unleash them on the mercenaries. Colonel Kell dispatched Salome Ward and her 
      Relentless Wolves to intercept him. Ward's company caught up with Nage just as he was nearing the depot. 
      She launched an attack as the Second Battalion's LAMs bombed the depot. 
      
      *This scenario is based on Battlecorps Scenario 3011, "Lowering the Boom", originally published in 
      the "Kell Hounds" sourcebook, FASA 01652.*

      In this scenario, it is your task to stop Col. Oliver Nage and his elements of 1st Company, 1st Battalion 
      from reaching the weapons depot which lies beyond the north edge of the map. They will try to reach and
      escape from this edge with as many Meks as possible.
      
      Some of their Meks have already sustained damage.

      ## Decisive Victory
      
      Not more than one Marik Mek managed to evade the Kell Hounds forces. The Kell Hounds
      have won a decivise victory.
      
      Ward's Wolves inflicted significant losses on the Marik Meks. Witnessing the smoke rising 
      from the depot and his units sustaining severe damage, Nage decided to flee, with the relentless 
      pursuit of the Wolves close behind.
