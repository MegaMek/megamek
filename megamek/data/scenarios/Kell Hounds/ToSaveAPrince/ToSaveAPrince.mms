      # Situation
      ## Mallory's World, Desolate Pass
      ## Federated Suns
      ## October 3013

      In a wave of assaults by House Kurita forces on Mallory's World, the Second Sword of Light
      Regiment, backed by the Twenty-fourth Dieron Regulars, landed and clashed with the defending Seventeenth
      Avalon Hussars. Prince Ian Davion, leading the Fourth Davion Guards, swiftly responded to the Combine's
      invasion.

      Despite early victories by Davion's forces, the Kurita units inflicted heavy damage on the
      Seventeenth Avalon Hussars, exposing the Fourth Guards to significant danger. In response, Prince Ian
      called for reinforcements from the Kell Hounds Regiment, stationed ten days away on Mara.

      By the time the Kell Hounds reached the battlefield, the situation for the defenders had grown dire. The
      Twenty-fourth Dieron Regulars had severed the Fourth Davion Guards' lines of communication and driven them
      into the desert, the Second Sword of Light Regiment in pursuit. At last, at Desolate Pass, Prince Ian turned
      his battered Atlas to confront the Warhammer of Yorinaga Kurita, commander of the Second Sword.

      In a desperate last stand Prince Ian Davion bought his regiment precious time to retreat, but did not
      survive the fight. Right before other Kurita forces could seize his body, the long-awaited Kell Hounds arrived.

      *This scenario is based on Battlecorps Scenario 3013, "To Save a Prince", originally published in
      the "Kell Hounds" sourcebook, FASA 01652.*

      ## Attacker's Task

      In this scenario, it is your task to break through the Kell Hounds defense line and exit at least half your
      Meks off the southern map edge by the end of round 15.

      The temperature in this desert area is at 70Â°C, adding heat to all Meks.

      The Kell Hounds managed to drive off the Second Sword of Light, enabling the Fourth Davion
      Guards to step in reclaim Prince Ian's body.

      Yorinaga Kurita is not pleased.

      ## Victory

      The Second Sword of Light successfully broke through the line of the Davion defenses. They will not
      recover their Prince's body. This will be a heavy blow to their morale.

      Yorinaga Kurita commends your performance by not being displeased.
