INSTRUCTIONS
------------
Just unzip into your MegaMek folder, and you're ready to go!

There are two scenario files, one for 2 players (Steiner vs Davion) and one for 4 players (Steiner2nd and Steiner7th vs Davion and ComStar).

This pack also includes a new board (montediablo.board) which is just an elevated version of openterrain1.

Because not all scenario-specific rules are implemented yet in the MegaMek Scenario system, it is important that you read this file carefully. It contains some additional constraints that should be followed in order to recreate the scenario as its designers intended.


SITUATION
---------
Monte Diablo, Giausar
Cavanaugh Theatre, Lyran Alliance
17 August 3065

    As the Federated Commonwealth Civil War heated up, many conscientious commanders attempted to maintain a neutral stance, trusting that the Federated Commonwealth was strong enough to resist the contest of wills that had flared up between Victor Steiner-Davion and his sister Katherine. As the struggle grew from a few isolated incidents of violence to a full blown civil war, these neutral commanders found themselves with fewer and fewer options. One such commander was Leutnant-General Andrew Giggins, Commanding Officer of the Fourth Crucis Lancers Regimental Combat Team.

    A tenth generation Federated Suns officer, General Giggins found himself torn between duty to the Federated Suns and to the Lyran Alliance planet of Giausar, his home for the previous decade. With a wife and three children native to the world, he had no wish to see the hell of civil war come to his home. He wasn't blind, however. He'd heard reports of units loyal to the Archon-Princess vying for control of worlds garrisoned by neutral commands. When he received a personal invitation from General of the Armies Nondi Steiner for he and his family to visit Tharkad, Giggins knew that he was out of options. He quickly met with his command staff and informed them of his decision to openly declare the Fourth Crucis Lancers for Victor Steiner-Davion.

    On 31 March 3064, the 4th Crucis Lancers officially announced their allegiance to Victor Steiner-Davion. The veteran Second Donegal Guards, already enroute to Giausar, landed a week later. What followed was a two-year struggle between the opposing forces. The Second Donegal received reinforcements in the form of the Seventh Donegal in February of the following year. In the meantime Leutnant-General Giggins waged a brilliant hit and run campaign across Giausar's eastern continent until he received his own reinforcements from ComStar's 167th Division that next July. Soon the two Davion loyal units embarked on a more proactive strategy.

    For their part, the Lyran forces, hampered by a convoluted chain of command and an intense rivalry between the two Donegal Guards' commanding officers, were unable to pin down the Davion forces long enough to bring their numerically superior forces into battle. At the same time, Giggins' own campaign wore down the two Lyran units' patience and supplies.

    Giggins' campaign took its toll, however. In desperate need of rest and refit, the majority of the Fourth Crucis Lancers stood down for a few days in August of 3065. Giggins himself occupied Monte Diablo, a lone promontory that afforded an excellent view of the surrounding countryside.

    A chance flyover by a Lyran reconnaissance craft revealed Giggins' position on the mountain. Leutnant-General Daniel Steiner-Voss, Commanding Officer of the Seventh Donegal Guards, recognized the chance to cut off the head of the Davion forces in one decisive stroke. Without Leutnant-General Giggins to lead them, and with no hope of further relief or reinforcement, the remaining Lancers and Com Guards would be forced to either surrender or face certain death.

    Leutnant-General Voss-Steiner hastily ordered all Lyran forces in the area of Monte Diablo to converge on the Davion forces and wipe them out. At dawn on 17 August 3065, the Lyran forces moved in for the kill.


DEPLOYMENT
----------
·Davion and ComStar units deploy anywhere on the Large Mountain map (columns 17XX to 32XX).
·Steiner units from the 7th Donegal Guards (Uziel, Lynx, Commando, Razorback) deploy along the West edge.
·Steiner units from the 2nd Donegal Guards deploy along the East edge.


VICTORY CONDITIONS
------------------
The scenario ends when one side is completely destroyed, has withdrawn, or otherwise leaves the map.

As soon as one of these conditions is fulfilled, calculate each sides point total and consult the Victory Level Table.
  +20 Points per each Davion or ComStar 'Mech destroyed
  +20 Points if Lt.-Gen. Giggins' 'Mech is destroyed
  -20 Points per each Lyran 'Mech destroyed
  -15 Points, each Lyran 'Mech forced to withdraw
  -10 Points for each operational Davion or ComStar 'Mech on Monte Diablo at the end of the game.


SPECIAL RULES
-------------
The following special rules apply during this scenario:

·Forced Withdrawal
    The Forced Withdrawal rule is in effect for the Lyran Forces. Lyran forces must retreat off their home map edges if they take Crippling Damage. Withdrawing units may not make physical attacks against enemy units. Withdrawing units may fire at enemy units if the enemy unit lies in their front arc and are between the withdrawing unit and the withdrawing unit's home map edge. Davion and ComStar units may not withdraw.

·Crippling Damage
    A BattleMech is considered crippled when: A side torso location is destroyed, the 'Mech takes 2 engine critical hits, it takes 4 or more pilot hits, or all of its weapons are destroyed. Any ammunition fed weapon is considered destroyed when its ammunition is depleted. If a 'Mech's weapons are destroyed and it can no longer move, it is considered destroyed.
