MegaMek, 2d6, and the Art of Rolling the Dice Without Losing Your Mechs—or Your Mind
September 9, 2023



Probability of Rolling Specific Numbers with 2d6
Ah, the humble 2d6, where the fate of your BattleMech hangs in the balance. Rolling two six-sided dice, you can end up with sums from 2 to 12, which in the world of BattleTech might mean the difference between a pinpoint laser shot to the cockpit or a miserable miss that scorches nothing but air. 

2, 12: 1 way to roll (Think of this as the Hail Mary of laser shots. You either nail it or you don’t.)
3, 11: 2 ways (These are your sniper shots—precious, but rare.)
4, 10: 3 ways (These rolls are like Medium Lasers; they get the job done but aren't fancy.)
5, 9: 4 ways (The reliable SRM6 of the dice world.)
6, 8: 5 ways (LRMs, anyone?)
7: 6 ways (Ah, the autocannon, spraying enough to make sure something hits.)

How Java RNG Works
Ever wonder how MegaMek decides whether your Gauss Rifle turns the opponent into scrap metal? Java's RNG is the wizard behind the curtain, using the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) formula to keep you guessing. It’s not the Inner Sphere's best tech, but it'll hold up for most of your mercenary contracts.

Perception of RNG as Biased: The Cockpit Diaries

Recency Bias
Example: "My Atlas just rolled three snake eyes in a row; this RNG is rigged!" Well, statistically, those rolls are as rare as finding a Star League cache, but they can happen. And no, the RNG isn't plotting against your MechWarrior career.

Confirmation Bias
Example: "Every time I play MegaMek, my LRMs might as well be shooting confetti." You’re convinced the RNG hates your missile racks. So every time you miss, it’s another log on the "MegaMek hates me" bonfire—even if the overall statistics are far less vindictive.

Human Perception of Randomness
Example: "Five PPC shots and they all missed? This isn't random; it's a conspiracy!" Sometimes, even the Draconis Combine couldn’t plan a more 'clustered' series of rolls, but that's how randomness rolls—pun intended.

Human Perception and Bias Impact
Let's face it: Between Clan tech superiority and the politics of the Inner Sphere, you already have enough to be paranoid about. But your Mech isn’t doomed by malicious code; it's often just your brain misinterpreting the whims of probability.

Small Sample Sizes and Statistical Fluctuations
Ah, the small sample size—the MechWarrior’s Achilles' heel. Here’s the rundown:

100 Rolls: At this level, you're just a rookie. Don't be shocked if you leg your own Mech a few times.

1,000 Rolls: OK, you've seen a few battles, but remember, even Kai Allard-Liao had bad days. Rolls of 7 should come up about 166.7 times, but if it's more like 150 or 180, don't junk your Mech just yet.


10,000 Rolls: By now, you're a legend like Natasha Kerensky. Expect most of your rolls to align pretty closely with the stats. If not, well, you can always blame it on ComStar interference.

Conclusion
In the galaxy of MegaMek, 2d6 rolls are as vital as fusion engines and as unpredictable as a Capellan assassination attempt. Whether you're a MechWarrior who thinks the dice are as rigged as Solaris VII matches, or a strategist seeking to optimize every PPC shot, understanding RNG and human bias can keep your cockpit a Zen space—even when the LRMs are flying.
