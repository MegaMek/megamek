# Versionstamp required to be recognized as a Scenario file 
# This can NOT be modified
MMSVersion=1

2. Campaign Game Integration
# This field allows you to assign an external number to the current game. This number will do 
# nothing now but an addition after action report can be generated and that report can be 
# identify the game by this number.  NOTE: This is a number field.
ExternalId=120934


3. Name of the Scenario 
# Name of the scenario 
Name=A Few Crystals More. This is the name of the scenario you are creating 

4. Scenario description 
# This is a description of the Scenario you are creating 
Description=Rhonda's Irregulars Scenario Pack, A Few Crystals More. Page 44. 

5. Board width, Board height (optional)
# Size of the whole map board in mapsheets.
# This specifies how many BattleTech mapsheets that will be used. BoardWidth Specifies how many maps will be 
# laid out East and West (Width). BoardHeight specifies how many maps will be laid out North and South (Height). 
# If no BoardWidth or BoardHeight is specified, 1x1 is assumed.
BoardWidth=1
BoardHeight=2

6. Map width, Map height (optional)

MapHeight=17

#NOTE: The total play area in hexes is (BoardWidth * MapWidth) by (BoardHeight * MapHeight)

7. Map(s) placement 
# Maps can be specified by name. The order is left-to-right, top-to-bottom 
# Any unspecified boards will be set to RANDOM Maps=deserthills,mountainlake
# If the map is in a subdirectory, the syntax is subdirectory/mapname:
# buildings/militarybase1, for example.
#
# Alternate Layout
# This lays out the specific maps for your scenario. Left to Right. If you use
# the "rotate:"  keyword, the board will appear rotated 180 degrees (North
# becomes South, East becomes West).
Maps=rotate:deserthills,rotate:mountainlake

8. Faction list 
# The player name used to log into the server MUST match this name to play as that faction 
# Factions=Irregulars,WacosRangers Faction List specifies the 2 Factions that will be battling in the scenario.

# Valid values are N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW,C (center), and R (random) 
# Example: Location_Kurita=C This is currently the only working way of a "specified" placement. It will place 
# all the Units in this location on the map randomly. It also determines facing randomly. 
Location_Irregulars=W
Location_WacosRangers=E

10. Faction minefields
# Gives the player minefields to deploy, the first number is conventional, the second
# command-detonated and the last is vibrabombs.
Minefields_Irregulars=2,0,2
Minefields_WacosRangers=1,0,3

11. Faction (A) Unit list 
# The format is: MechRef,PilotName,PilotGunnery,PilotPiloting,facing,x,y 
# Facing and coordinates are optional. Facing is one of NW, N, NE, SE, S, SW 
# Example: Unit_Irregulars_1=HGN-732,Col Rhonda Snord,2,1,N,01,32 

# Irregulars 1st Command Lance: 
Unit_Irregulars_1=Archer ARC-2R,Col Cranston Snord,1,2,S,06,00

# Here is where you specify a "Unit" (be it Mech, Infantry, Vehicle or BattleArmor) for side A. 
# Format is as follows: 
# Unit name (Must match Faction List) Unit Number. Must be sequential, if a number is skipped, it will not place 
# the units after it. 
# Mech Type with variant Pilot Name Pilot,Gunnery skills Facing. 
# Here are the available options: N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW,C (center), and R (random) 
# Hex Placement. The first set of numbers specifies the Hex the unit is in, second set of numbers is the Hex it 
# is facing. (NOTE: The Hex Placement option is NOT used in the current version). 

12. Faction (B) Unit list 
# The format is: MechRef,PilotName,PilotGunnery,PilotPiloting,facing,x,y 
# Facing and coordinates are optional. Facing is one of NW, N, NE, SE, S, SW

Unit_WacosRangers_4=Cyclops CP-10-Z,Sgt Lenny Markbright,3,3,N,08,12 

# Here is where you specify a "Unit" (be it Mech, Infantry, Vehicle or BattleArmor) for side A. 
# Format is as follows: 
# Unit name (Must match Faction List) Unit Number. Must be sequential, if a number is skipped, it will not place 
# the units after it. 
# Mech Type with variant Pilot Name Pilot,Gunnery skills Facing. 
# Here are the available options: N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW,C (center), and R (random) 
# Hex Placement. The first set of numbers specifies the Hex the unit is in, second set of numbers is the Hex it 
# is facing. (NOTE: The Hex Placement option is NOT used in the current version). 


13. Faction Deployment
# You may now set a turn for deployment of a unit to occur.  These units must have a deployment location 
# specified in the unit list.
#
# The unit below will deploy at its preset location on turn 3
Unit_Kurita_1_DeploymentRound=3

14. Campaign Unit Integration
# To help manage units over a long campaign you can now assign external id to each unit.  These ids will do 
# nothing now but an addition after action report can be generated and units within that report can be 
# identified by this number.  NOTE: This is a number field.
Unit_WacosRangers_1_ExternalID=1


15. Advantages:
# Additional advantages to add to pilots. Most of these require the 'MaxTech Level3 Pilot Advantages' game
# option to be turned on. The possible values are:
# dodge_maneuver, maneuvering_ace, melee_specialist, pain_resistance
# Multiple advantages for one pilot are separated by spaces
Unit_Irregulars_2_Advantages=melee_specialist pain_resistance
Unit_WacosRangers_2_Advantages=dodge_maneuver

16. Initial Damage to Units:
# There are multiple ways to initially damage units.  First you can specify a number of blocks of damage to a
# unit.  The damage will be grouped into blocks of 5 points and distributed randomly using that standard damage
# location charts.  Any internal and/or critical hits will be resolved normally. NOTE:  This can result in the
# unit being destroyed before the game begins.
Unit_WacosRangers_1_Damage=5

# Another way to apply damage to a unit is by specifying the armor/internal struction left for each location.
# Using this chart:
# Mech Locations
# 	HEAD=0,CT=1,RT=2,LT=3,RARM=4,LARM=5,RLEG=6,LLEG=7
# Example for Mechs:
#   N0:1 Means Normal Armor Location 0 Set to 1
#   I2:2 Means Internal Armor Location 2 Set to 2
#   R2:3 Means Rear Armor Location 2 Set to 3
#
# Tank Locations
# 	Body=0,FRONT=1,RIGHT=2,LEFT=3,REAR=4,TURRET=5
#
# Infantry Location
#	Men = 0 (Will set the number of men in the platoon)
#
# Battle Armor
#      Unit#=0(First Unit Number) to Armor 
#      EG Unit_Kurita_3_DamageSpecific=N2:1,N3:0
#          Will set unit 3 to have 1 Armor Remaining
#          while unit 4 Destroyed
#
# Proto Mechs
#      Head=0,Torso =1,RARM=2,LARM=3,LEGS=4,Main Gun=5
# 
# The unit below will start with 3 internal structure points left in the center torso and 2 armor points left
# in the right torso. 
Unit_WacosRangers_1_DamageSpecific=I1:3,N2:2

# Yet another way is by applying critical hits to specific locations within a unit.
# Using this chart, critical hits can be applied to any filled slot.
# Mech Crit Hits
# 	HEAD=0,CT=1,RT=2,LT=3,RARM=4,LARM=5,RLEG=6,LLEG=7
# 	Slots starting from 1 to the number of filled critical slots
#
# Vehicle Crit Hits
#       Location is zero.
#       Slots is one of the following:
# 	1 = Crew stunned for 3 turns
# 	2 = Main weapon jams for 1 turn
# 	3 = Engine Destroyed Immobile
# 	4 = Crew killed (tank dead)
# 	5 = Fuel Tank/Engine Shielding (tank dead) 
# 	6 = Power Plant Hit (tank dead)
#
# Proto Mechs
# 	Head=0,Torso=1,RARM=2,LARM=3,LEGS=4,Main Gun=5
# 	Slots starting from 1 to the number of critical hit boxes
#
#       In addition, you can specify whether the Torso weapons
#       should be damaged by damaging the following torso "slots":
#               Torso Weapon A=5,Torso Weapon B=6
#
# The unit below has had critical hits to the center torso slots 3 and 2
Unit_WacosRangers_1_CritHit=1:3,1:2

# Lastly you can damage the mech pilot directly by assigning the pilot hits.
Unit_WacosRangers_1_PilotHits=1


17. Ammunition Setup
# Set Ammo Ammount(Only Works for Mechs)
#
# Note will not be able to specify a value larger then Inital Ammo
# 
# Loc and Slots are the same as Crit Locations
#
# The unit below Would have its ammo in right torso slot 11 set to 3
# 
Unit_WacosRangers_1_SetAmmoTo=2:11-3



18. Game options
# This is an xml file which can be created by copying your
# mmconf/gameoptions.xml
# path is specified relative to the scenario file
# This is one way to set victory conditions
GameOptionsFile=Example_options.xml



19. Camo options
# Set a camo for the player
# Replace Category and File with the appropriate names 
Camo_Faction=Category,File
# Set a unit specific individual camo
# Again, replace Category and File with the appropriate names
Unit_WacosRangers_1_Camo=Category,File
# Destroy the enemy!
