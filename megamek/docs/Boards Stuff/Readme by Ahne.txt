The "LargeTextures" tileset file is already updated to replace the current large texture tileset in the megamek client with all the textures used in this texture pack. It can easily changed by name and than made accesible in the client graphics tilset options.

To test the pack just drag/drop the 

../Ahne folder into ..data/images/hexes and also the largeTextures.Tileset file in the the same place.


Ingame just change to LargeTextures tileset in the client graphics settings.
Later it should be an own selectable from the available options.

If you also want to use the updated roof textures you have to seperately copy/replace existing ones in their folders,
i dont know why i cant load them from my own largeTextures tileset file, maybe someone can look into that. 

 iLarge_Textures_hardened/"files" -> ..data/images/hexes/hardened/
 iLarge_Textures_light/"files" -> ..data/images/hexes/light/
 iLarge_Textures_heavy/"files" -> ..data/images/hexes/heavy/
 iLarge_Textures_megaart/"files" -> ..data/images/hexes/megaart/

(there are still some roof textures not 100% alligned but it works pretty fine)




greetings
Ahne
