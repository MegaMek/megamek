Map generator enhancements
--------------------------

Integration of map generator with map editor
 - you can now create random terrain to seed a new map.
 - just press Okay to get a blank map as before.

New terrain features
 - Swamps can stack with woods and roughs in the same hex
 - Pavements for patches of ice / places to put buildings
 - Craters available on basic menu
 - Theme can be set when generating the map, to use the alternate graphics (snow, lunar, mars...)

Terrain special effects (advanced menu)
 - Drought, dries up water on the map to leave lower water, swamp or rough.
   Use river + drought to get a dried up river bed.
   FX modifier adjusts the severity of the drought
 - Fires, clears and ignites woods for a map that looks like a battle just finished
   A low % chance on high temperature worlds could give riflemen a nasty shock
   FX modifier adjusts balance between cleared and untouched hexes
 - Frozen, converts water and swamp to ice (pavement)
   Adds atmosphere to low temperature worlds with frozen lakes and rivers a possibility
 - Flood, fills negative hex levels with water and level 0 with swamp
   Fen / salt marsh / coastline type maps.  Hovercraft at their finest.
   FX modifier adjusts sea level.

Combining effects
 - Flood + Drought
   Rocky shores - not so good for hovers.
   FX modifier -1 worked well
 - Flood + Frozen
   Glacier / ice shelf

Defects fixed
 - The alternate elevation algorithm and text in advanced settings expected hilliness 0-1000.
   But default elevation algorithm and enforced settings expected 0-99.
   Modified to use the 0-99 range
Defects introduced :)
 - Advanced map settings is quite a big list now, it should maybe be split into two columns...
   GridBagLayout makes my head hurt
 - More localisation needed for the german & russian
