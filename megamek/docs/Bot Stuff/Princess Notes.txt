Who or What is Princess.
Introducing Princess, the crown jewel of MegaMek's AI warriors, notorious for her rapid-fire decision-making and royal impatience. She's not your average bot; think of her as the offspring of 'Clever Girl' and 'Fire Girl'—brilliantly tactical in the heat of the moment yet as predictably unpredictable as fire itself. Named for her blazing speed—outpacing the old testbot by a factor of fifty—she rules the battlefield with the impetuousness of a true princess.

Within the digital confines of MegaMek, Princess reigns supreme in her own chaotic domain, executing each turn with a precision that’s dazzlingly effective yet bewilderingly short-sighted. She's a master of the immediate, squeezing every ounce of potential from the present turn with a tactical acumen that leaves her human adversaries in awe. Yet, don't ask her about the 'next move' in the grand scheme—our beloved Princess has a knack for living (and battling) in the moment, often forgetting her grand strategy as soon as the next round begins.

So here's the inside scoop, dear players: While Princess might outmaneuver you in the short run, her inability to think turn over turn is her Achilles' heel. But underestimate her at your own peril; her next move is as much a surprise to her as it is to you, making every game an adventurous foray into the unpredictable mind of MegaMek's most enigmatic AI.

In a wink to you, the savvy gamer, remember this: Princess is more than code and strategy; she's a narrative woven into the very fabric of the MegaMek universe, challenging you to adapt, anticipate, and enjoy the tumultuous ride. Prepare to engage with an opponent who is part tactical genius, part whimsical sovereign, and entirely in a league of her own.


MegaMek contains a single bot client, Princess. First, we'll go through the basic settings for princess and what they mean. Second, we'll go through the basic commands for Princess. Third, we'll discuss how to run separate instances of Princess to keep different types of units using different tactics. Finally, we'll go through the Optional Rules Princess can use.

1)
Behavior - There are 4 behaviors pre-configured with Princess:
     �DEFAULT - Basic "balanced" settings.
     �BERSERK - Highly aggressive. Princess will ignore danger to herself and will not run away under any circumstances.
     �COWARDLY - Really doesn't want to get shot.
     �ESCAPE - Not quite as fearful as cowardly but she will try to escape from her home board edge ASAP.

You can also enter a name to save your own configurations for later games or for use with the replacePlayer command.

Verbosity - Used to set the level of logging Princess will use. DEBUG mode is very verbose. It is recommended you only use it when trying to debug something specific.

Forced Withdrawal - Used to make the Princess follow the Forced Withdrawal rules outlined in Total Warfare.

Immediate Withdrawal - Used to make Princess send her units to her home edge from the start of the game, regardless of damage level. This can be handy for Chase and Breakthrough scenarios.

Auto Flee Board - (Only available when Immediate Withdrawal is in effect.) If this is checked, Princess will issue the Flee command as soon as her units reach her home edge, regardless of damage level.

Home Edge - Defines which edge Princess will attempt to flee across when Forced Withdrawal is in effect.


Behavior Settings


Bravery - This determines how much return fire Princess is willing to risk in order to do damage to the enemy.

Self Preservation - This determines how quickly Princess will flee once Forced Withdrawal takes effect. At lower levels, she will attempt more of a fighting withdrawal, while at higher levels she should run straight for her home edge.

Aggression - This determines how much Princess wants to close with her enemies. Lower settings will cause her to try to keep her distance more, while higher settings will have her get right up in her enemies' faces.

Herding - The higher this value, the more Princess will try to keep her units together.

Piloting Caution - This determines how willing Princess is to fail a piloting roll and fall on her face when attempting various maneuvers. Higher settings means that Princess will risk fewer piloting rolls. Note, this also affects how willing she is to use MASC or try to move through or on buildings.

Strategic Targets - This allows you to provide Princess with a list of hex coordinates or unit ids to move to and attack. If a building exists in a target hex, then she will attempt to destroy that building. If a unit with the given id is on the enemy team, she will give that target a higher priority ignoring easier shots over the Strategic Target.


The key to setting Princess up is using the above settings together and realizing that she tends to chose the best overall tactic with her limits. Without tweaking settings, this almost invariably means Princess charging in. Setting Bravery and Aggression to lower levels will have Princess keep at longer ranges. The real key to having Princess use units to their fullest is to break them down into roles, tweaking the settings for each. Princess doesn't use units together operating each individually, but with the same overall tactics. This means she'll often focus fire on one of your units, even to extreme levels. This also means that one instance of Princess will have a Longbow follow a bunch of brawlers into short range.

Chat Commands

Chat commands can only be given to an allied Princess player (on the same team). If you are playing solo and will want to change settings on the fly you can open a separate instance of MM and join the game (making sure to set the team to the bot's side). With this you can issue Behavior changing commands to the bot.

Flee
princessName: flee : 0-4 [0=north, 1=south, 2=west, 3=east, 4=nearest edge]
Causes princess-controlled units to start fleeing the board, regardless of damage level or Forced Withdrawal setting, in the specified direction.

Verbose
princessName: verbose : <error/warning/info/debug>
Sets princess's verbosity level.

Behavior
princessName: behavior : behaviorName
Change's princess's behavior to the named behavior.

princessName: caution : <+/->
Modifies princess's Piloting Caution setting. Each '+' increases it by 1 and each '-' decreases it by one.

Modifies princess's Self Preservation setting. Each '+' increases it by 1 and each '-' decreases it by one.

Aggression

Replacing an Absent Player with the Princess Bot

If a player has become disconnected (the word "(ghost)" appears next to their name, you can replace that player with a bot. There are two methods for replacing a player. The first is the Edit Bots command under the File menu. This will bring up a version of the Bot Config Dialog along with a list of players that can be replaced. The second option is to use the /replacePlayer command in the chat window:

    /replacePlayer -b:Princess <-c:ConfigName> <-v:VerbosityLevel> <-p:>PlayerName

Princess will replace the named player.
<-b> Specifies the use of Princess. If left out, TestBot will be used instead.
<-c> Specifies a saved configuration to be used by Princess. If left out DEFAULT will be used.
<-v> Specifies the verbosity level used to log Princess (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR). If left out, ERROR will be used.
<-p> Specifies the player to be replaced. The "-p:" is only required with the "-c:" or "-v:" parameters are also used.

Running Separate Instances of MegaMek
Once you have your basic game set up, start a second game (called an instance to reduce confusion) of MegaMek. 'Connect as a Computer Player', then set up the Behaviors as you want. If the units the bot is supposed to use are already in the first instance, you can go back to that and click on each mech (or shift-click for multiple ones) and change teams as you wish.

Note1: You don't have to operate in this fashion, you can have one game run all the bot clients you wish. The only time you HAVE to run a separate instance is when you will want to change Behaviors for the bot client(s). I prefer to use this fashion for larger or longer games as it allows you to have separate logs and save games. I believe it does speed up Princess' decision making to have separate instances open.
Note2: The more bots you have running and the more units each one controls, the more memory MM will use. Running separate instances will compound this memory issue. This doesn't really seem to be a problem with modern machines.
Note3: Multiple Princess bots within one instance of MM can be on the same C3 or C3i network.

My suggestion is to run a bot for each role or sub-group you want to stay together and/or work under the same rules.
