November 17th new maps:

	8x8 Volga City A-J -- 8x8 city maps, combine them
			      however you want, just don't rotate!

	16x17 Black Forest A-D -- some more 16x17 maps, this time
				  an update for those of you who want
				  a more 'solid' Ewoklandia...

	16x17 Canyoneer A-D -- a simple canyonlands mapset that can
			       be combined however you like

	16x17 Wet Boots A-D -- a new favorite of mine, small streams
			       and rivers crisscrossing in every which
			       way...

	35x35 A Bridge Too Far -- deploy north and south and have at it!

	35x35 Polar Wastes -- snowy, icy, rocky northern landscape

	45x45 Mountain -- a new contender to replace that old KotH map?

Notes:

	Sorry for there not being much else new: I've been quite
	busy! I only released this because I was updating the
	website, and Hemlock Pass is my favored map right now so
	I was tempted to share it. :)
