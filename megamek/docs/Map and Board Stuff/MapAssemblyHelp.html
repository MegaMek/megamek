<H2> Ground and Atmospheric Maps</H2>
A ground map or atmospheric map is constructed of one or more boards. All boards of the game map must be the same size but that size can be chosen freely.
<P>The setup of the game map can be saved and loaded using the buttons below the map preview.
<P>To assemble a ground or atmospheric map, select the width and height of the map, i.e. the number of boards that make up the game map. Then select the board size you want to use from the list of available board sizes. You can choose "Custom Size" and set the board size manually.
<P>By default, each board of the game map is a generated board. Generated boards use settings that can be viewed or changed in the dialog reached by the "Generated Map Settings" button to create a board when the game starts. If you want to use a specific board from the list of available boards on the right, drag that board to the map preview. You can also use the right-click menu to assign boards. Boards can also be re-arranged in the map preview via drag-and-drop.
<P>You can select and drag multiple boards at once. In that case, a "Surprise" board will be used in the game map. At the start of the game, one of the selected boards will be used for the game map.
<P>Note: for both generated and surprise maps, the board that the map preview shows is only an example and the board that will appear when the game starts can be different.

<H2> Space Maps</H2>
<P>When you select a Space Map, the game's map will be an empty space map. You can only set the size of the map.
