This class sets up a random name generator that can then be used to generate random pilot names. It has a couple of
different settings and flexible input file directory locations

Files are located in `Configuration::namesDir`. All files are comma-spaced csv files.

The `historicalEthnicity.csv` file shows the correspondence between the different ethnic names and their numeric code in
the database. This file is used to initialize the name mapping, and must be kept current for all additions. The same
numeric code MUST be used across all the files listed below. The numeric codes MUST be listed in exact sequential
order (NO skipped numbers) for the load to work correctly.

The name database is located in three files: `maleGivenNames.csv`, `femaleGivenNames.csv`, and `surnames.csv`.

The database is divided into three fields; an Integer Ethnic Code, a String name, and an Integer weight. The Ethnic Code
is an Integer identifying the ethnic group from the historicalEthnicity.csv file the name is from The Name is a String
containing either a male/female first name or a surname, dependant on the origin file. The Weight is an Integer used to
set the generation chance of the name. The higher the number, the more common the name is.

Faction files are located in `factions` subdirectory of {@link Configuration#namesDir()} The faction key is the filename
without the extension. The faction files will have varying number of fields depending on how many ethnic groups exist.
The faction file does two things:

- First, it identifies the relative frequency of different ethnic surnames for a faction.
- Second, it identifies the correspondence between first names and surnames.

This allows, for example, for more Japanese first names regardless of surname in the Draconis Combine. There MUST be a
line in the Faction file for each ethnic group, although a weight of 0 can be used to prevent the generation of
grouping of names

This is divided into 3 + n fields, where n is the number of ethnic groups listed in `historicalEthnicity.csv`, divided
into the following groupings:

- The Integer Ethnic Code is the first field
- The String Ethnic Name is the second field. This is included for ease of reference, and is NOT used by the generator.
- The Integer Weight for generating a surname of the specified ethnicity. The higher the number, the more common the
  surname is for a faction.

This is followed by n fields each containing the Integer Weight for generating a given name for the ethnicity with
Ethnic Code n. The higher the number for the weight, the more common that given name ethnicity is in generation for the
specific ethnicity of the generated surname.
