Tech Progression Changes
Dec 11/2021

By Hammer

When tech progression in MegaMek was implemented it used the Universal Technology Advancement Table from Interstellar Operations (pg 32-). It was our understanding these tables where complete and superceded the tables in TRO Prototypes and RS NTNU 3145. After we implemented it I was informed by members of CGL Record Sheet team that the IntOps implemention had numerous errors. 

With this commit I have tried to reconcile the three tables. I would strongly recommend people use the variable tech level option under the configuration tab of MegaMekLab for building. This represented the best way to consolidate the three tables.

I used the following order of precedince for these changes:

1) NTNU 3145 tables - in the event of a conflict these tables are considered primary.
2) TRO Prototypes - these tables would supercede the tables in IntOps.
3) Table in Interstellar Operations.

Process to change the dates:

I first checked the tables in TRO Prototypes for a piece of equipment. 
Checked to see if the equipment existed on NTNU table. 

If it was on both tables:
	NTNU dates and tech level take precedince
	Variable tech level information updated
	Static Tech level set to match NTNU

If if was only on either Prototypes or NTNU:
	The table information from the specific book takes precedince. 
	As above variable tech level, and static tech level updated to match publication
	
If not on TRO Prototypes or RS NTNU.
	Tech Progression per IntOps retained.
	If missing a Static tech level one was added based on the last entry in IntOps table.
	
	
A big result of these changes is Static levels now reflect the equipment tech level for the Dark Ages rather than the start of the Jihad.
