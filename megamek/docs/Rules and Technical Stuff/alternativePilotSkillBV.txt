================================================================================


This chart corrects the errors on the current Total Warfare/Tech Manual chart and streamlines the pilot skills for quick reference/usage. The only change is reducing the base piloting to 10% per level below 5 from TechManual's base 15%, making the quintessential 3/4 a 32% gain, rather than 36%.

Under the current rule set, piloting BV increases generally favor the lower-skilled 'swarm' vs. the highly-skilled, smaller army. Armor and tonnage disparity is cited as the primary reason for this difference and piloting increases eventually reach a level of diminishing returns quite early. The skill table below will possibly replace the canon table in Cycle 3 of MekWars: The Wars of Reaving.
