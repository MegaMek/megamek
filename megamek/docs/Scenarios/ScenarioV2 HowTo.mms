# This document explains how to write a scenario V2 file.
# ScenarioV2 uses YAML formatting which relies heavily on indentation

# Note that this file itself is not a well-formed scenario as it shows multiple examples of
# tags that may only be used once.

  This scenario visits a fight of McCormack's Fusiliers in the campaign on Bellatrix against Ajax's
  Avengers. The retreating Avengers tried deperately to shake the Highlanders as they fled east across the southern continent of
  Bellatrix, but to no avail. Exhausted and bogged down by bad weather, the Avengers had no choice but to stand and fight.

# ###############################################
# Game End, Victory and Victory/Defeat/Other Messages
# are three separate things.

# The game ends when any of the game end trigger conditions is met *at the end of a round*. Note that end
# triggers *must not* use the "once" nor the "atend" modifier, but they can use the "not" modifier.
# When the game ends, all victory conditions are checked to see which team wins. If no conditions are met, the
# game is a draw.
# In addition to the end triggers, the game can also end when a victory condition is met at the end of a round
# and that victory condition does not have the onlyatend modifier, see the victory: tag below.

# end: is always followed by an array of triggers, i.e. dashes must be used: - trigger:

      The Second Sword of Light successfully broke through the line of the Davion defenses. They will not
