# UNIT SHADING SCRIPTS

Sept 17/2016

The scripts are located in the megamek\data\images\widgets\Unit Shading Scripts folder.

These are the new scripts used in GIMP to convert any of the sprites to the new shaded look. The original unshaded
Sprites are stored on GitHub with the Megamek extras. The extra's folder is updated a couple of times a year.

NOTES ON USE:
These go in C:\Program Files\GIMP 2\share\gimp\2.0\scripts

You'll have to either restart gimp to get them to load or go to the menu → filters → script fu → refresh scripts.

When you install those to the correct folder, they should appear in gimp under the menu → filters → light and shadow.
