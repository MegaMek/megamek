Turn Timer Option - Apr 19/2020
by Graysho

The turn timer works as a count down for movement and fire phase, visible as a progress bar with label on the menu bar in movement and fire phase

If set to 0 in game options, it is deactivated.

Once the time, defined in options runs out, the turn of the player ends with the current state. It is as if the player had clicked the "Fire" or "Move" button.

In fire phase, if time runs out while you are still selecting weapons to fire, those selected until time runs out will fire.
In movement, if you have selected a path on the map, the unit will move the path, as selected at the moment of time end.
