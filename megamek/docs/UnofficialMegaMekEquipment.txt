This file contains a list of the (legacy) unofficial equipment included in MegaMek. The current policy is that no further unofficial equipment will be added.
Ranges are given as Minimum/Short/Medium/Long range values.

*AC/10i - 10 Damage, 3 Heat, 12 Tons, 7 Crits, Range 1/7/15/20, 10 shots/ton.
The above item is a non-canon "improved-range" AC/10. It can only use its own "AC/10i" standard ammo. 
Outside of that and the altered statistics, it uses the same rules as a standard autocannon.
---
*AC/15 - 15 Damage, 5 Heat, 13 Tons, 8 Crits, Range -/4/8/12, 7 shots/ton.
The above item is a non-canon intermediate autocannon size between the AC/10 and AC/20.
Outside of its altered statistics, it uses the same rules as a standard autocannon, including the ability to use alternate AC ammo types.
---
*GAC/2 - 4 Damage, 2 Heat, 8 Tons, 2 Crits, Range 4/8/16/24, 22 shots/ton. (Anomaly - can use standard AC/2 ammo instead of GAC/2 ammo, with twice the shots per ton)
*GAC/4 - 8 Damage, 4 Heat, 12 Tons, 4 Crits, Range 4/8/16/24, 11 shots/ton.
*GAC/6 - 12 Damage, 6 Heat, 14 Tons, 4 Crits, Range 4/8/16/24, 7 shots/ton.
*GAC/8 - 16 Damage, 8 Heat, 16 Tons, 4 Crits, Range 4/8/16/24, 5 shots/ton.
The above items are "Gatling Autocannons", non-canon weapons added by "BATTLEMASTER". 
They receive -1 to hit, can use the alternate ammo types available to standard autocannon, and can be rapid-fired like standard ACs.
---
*Kinslaughter H ER PPC - 10 Damage, 13 Heat, 7 Tons, 3 Crits, Range -/4/10/16
The above item is a variant of ER PPC mentioned in Rhonda's Irregulars / Technical Readout: 3058.
It is not considered canon. It has slightly different statistics than a standard IS ER PPC, but no other special features.
In any case, it is introduced in 2740 at the very earliest and goes extinct in 2860, making it generally unavailable.
---
*LAC/10 - 10 Damage, 3 Heat, 8 Tons, 4 Crits, Range -/3/6/9, 10 shots/ton.
*LAC/20 - 20 Damage, 7 Heat, 9 Tons, 6 Crits, Range -/2/4/6, 5 shots/ton.
The above items are unofficial "Light" versions of the AC/10 and AC/20, based off the canon LAC2/LAC5.
The only difference between the canon and non-canon versions is the altered statistics - they follow the same rules.
Due to this, they can use alternate AC ammo types and be rapid-fired.
---
*Plasma Rifle (Clan) - 10 Damage, 15 Heat, 6 Tons, 2 Crits, Range 2/6/14/22
The above unofficial weapon, while called a "Plasma Rifle", functions rather differently from the canon IS Plasma Rifle.
It does not use ammunition, does not deal extra damage to non-heat-tracking targets, and generally functions as a simple 10-damage DE weapon against such targets.
Against heat-tracking targets, it adds a fixed 5 heat to the target, unless the struck location mounts Reflective or Heat-Dissipating armor, in which case it adds 2.
---
*Rail Gun - 22 Damage, 1 Heat, 18 Tons, 9 Crits, Range 1/6/13/19, 5 shots/ton.
The above item is an unofficial weapon. 
Outside of its altered statistics, it functions like a Gauss Rifle (including exploding for 20 points of damage when it takes a critical hit).
---
*Rotary AC/10 - 10 Damage, 3 Heat, 14 Tons, 7 Crits, Range -/6/12/18, 10 shots/ton.
*Rotary AC/20 - 20 Damage, 7 Heat, 16 Tons, 10 Crits, Range -/4/8/12, 5 shots/ton.
The above items are unofficial Rotary versions of the AC/10 and AC/20, based off the canon RAC2/RAC5.
The only difference between the canon and non-canon versions is the altered statistics.
They follow the same rules (i.e. fire 1-6 shots, heat and ammo use is per shot, roll on cluster table for how many shots hit, etc).
