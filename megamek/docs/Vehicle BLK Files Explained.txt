This is a text document explaining the workings of *.BLK files for vehicles.  For ground vehicles:

#building block data file
<BlockVersion>
1
</BlockVersion>
#Write the version number just in case...
<Version>
MAM0
</Version>

The next few lines are pretty self explanatory:

<UnitType>
Tank
</UnitType>
<Name>
LRM Carrier
</Name>
<Model>
(3055)
</Model>
<Tonnage>
60
</Tonnage>
<cruiseMP>
2
</cruiseMP>
<armor>
14
14
14
12
</Armor>

UnitType needs to be "VTOL" for VTOLs, "Tank" for normal vehicles,
"SupportTank" for Support Vehicles, "SupportVTOL" for Support VTOLs,
"LargeSupportTank" for large support vehicle.

Name, Model, Tonnage and Cruise MP are self explanatory.

The armor values are each location's armor values, in this order:
-For Tanks: Front, Left, Right, Rear, and if the unit has a Turret, Turret.
-For VTOLs: Front, Left, Right, Rear, Rotor
-For Large Support Tanks: Front, Front Right, Front Left, Rear Right, Rear Left,
 Rear, and if the unit has a Turret, Turret.
-If the tank has two turrets:  Front, Left, Right, Rear, Front Turret, Rear Turret.


Then you have an entry for each location that mounts equipment.

<Front Equipment>
ISLRM20
ISArtemisIV
ISLRM20
ISArtemisIV
ISLRM20
ISArtemisIV
</Front Equipment>

<Right Equipment>
</Right Equipment>

<Left Equipment>
</Left Equipment>

<Rear Equipment>
</Rear Equipment>

<Body Equipment>
ISLRM20 Ammo Artemis-capable

</Body Equipment>

<Rear Turret Equipment>
Light PPC
PPC Capacitor
ISMML9
</Rear Turret Equipment>

<Front Turret Equipment>
ISMagshotGR
ISMagshotGR
</Front Turret Equipment>

"<Front Equipment>" for equipment mounted in the front, "<Rear Equipment>" for
rear, "<Body Equipment>" for the body, "<Turret Equipment>" for the turret, etc.
For large support tank, the side ones become "Front Left Equipment" etc.  If the
tank has two turrets, there is an entry for "Front Turret Equipment" and
"Rear Turret Equipment".

Then comes the <type> entry:

<type>
IS Level 2
</type>

The entry depends on the unit's tech level, the following values are what needs
to be used:

"IS Level 1"
Introductory box set
"IS Level 2"
IS TW
"IS Level 3"
Advanced tech
"IS Level 4"
Experimental tech
"IS Level 5"
IS unofficial/old tech (you probably won't need this.)
"Clan Level 2"
Clan TW
"Clan Level 3"
Clan advanced
"Clan Level 4"
Clan experimental
"Clan Level 5"
Clan unofficial/old tech (you probably won't need this._

For mixed tech, these are used:
Mixed (IS Chassis)
Mixed (IS Chassis) Experimental
Mixed (IS Chassis) Unofficial
Mixed (Clan Chassis)
Mixed (Clan Chassis) Experimental
Mixed (Clan Chassis) Unofficial

Next is the entry for the year this unit originated in:

<year>
3055
</year>

then we set the internal structure, armor and engine type:

<internal_type>
0
</internal_type>
<armor_type>
1
</armor_type>
<engine_type>
1
</engine_type>

For internal structure, 0 means standard, 1 means Endo-Steel, 2 means Endo-Steel
Prototype, 3 means reinforced, 4 means composite.  These are only really important for battlemechs.

The armor values are 0 standard, 1 Ferro-Fibrous, 2 reactive, 3 reflective, 4
hardened, 5 light ferro, 6 heavy ferro, 8 stealth, 9 ferro-fib prototype, 10
commercial, 14 industrial, 15 heavy industrial.  Some of these might not apply
for tanks.

For the engine types, the following codes apply:

Fusion: 0
ICE: 1
XL: 2
XXL: 3
LIGHT: 4
COMPACT: 5
Fuel Cell: 6
Fission: 7

For Support Tanks, you'll also need an entry named "barrating" to set the BAR
rating, we do not yet automatically set that based on the armor type set earlier.
So you'll need something like this:

<barrating>
5
</barrating>

Next up is the motion type of the tank:

<motion_type>
Tracked
</motion_type>

The values are:

Tracked
Wheeled
Hover
VTOL
Naval
Hydrofoil
Submarine
WiGE

For OmniTanks, you'll need to add these lines:

<omni>
1
</omni>

For tanks that have infantry bays, you'll need an entry along these lines:

<transporters>
TroopSpace:3
</transporters>

This example would give the unit a 3 ton infantry bay.




Aerospace units are not much different from this format.  Here is a Sabutai for an example:

#building block data file
<BlockVersion>
1
</BlockVersion>
#Write the version number just in case...
<Version>
MAM0
</Version>
<UnitType>
Aero
</UnitType>

Notice that in this case, the unit type is set to Aero.  You can also set it to
Dropship, Jumpship, Warship, and SpaceStation.

<Name>
Sabutai
</Name>
<Model>
Prime
</Model>
<Tonnage>
75
</Tonnage>
<SafeThrust>
6
</SafeThrust>
<Armor>
62
45
45
40
</Armor>

-For aerodynes, armor is arranged as Nose, Left Wing, Right Wing, and Aft.
-For sphereoids, armor is arranged as Nose, Left side, Right Side, and Aft.
-For jumpships, warships, and space stations, armor is arranged as Nose,
 Front Left Side, Front Right Side, Aft Left Side, Aft Right Side, and Aft.
 ***Note that armor for jumpships, warships and space stations is in
 capital scale.

The following sections are more or less the same as vehicles.

<Nose Equipment>
CLGaussRifle
CLGauss Ammo
CLERSmallLaser
</Nose Equipment>
<Left Wing Equipment>
CLERPPC
CLLargePulseLaser
</Left Wing Equipment>
<Right Wing Equipment> 
CLERPPC
CLLargePulseLaser
</Right Wing Equipment>
<Aft Equipment> 
CLERSmallLaser
CLERSmallLaser
</Aft Equipment>

For jumpships, warships, and space stations, they have "<Front Left Side Equipment>",
"<Aft Right Side Equipment>", etc.  Weapons rear-mounted on dropship wings can be
denoted by playing a (R) before the weapon ("(R) CLERPPC").  To create different
weapon bays, place a (B) in front of a group of weapons and at the end of a group
to create a bay ("(R) (B) CLLargePulseLaser").

Make sure you have fuel for your aircraft!

<fuel>

<year>

<engine_type>

</motion_type>
<omni>
1
</omni>


The following fields are more or less for large craft:

<transporters>
SmallCraftBay:8:1
CargoBay:91509:1
</transporters>

These denote cargo bays for holding fighters, 'mechs, cargo, etc.
Valid fields include:

MechBay:62:2
ASFBay:43:2
InfantryBay:160:1
BattleArmorBay:200:1
HeavyVehicleBay:100:2
CargoBay:6038:1
SmallCraftBay:2:1

The format is BayType:#Units or Tons of Cargo:# Doors Available for Bays

Docking collars denote how many dropships can be carried.

<docking_collar>
4
</docking_collar>


The following are pretty self-explanatory:

<grav_deck>
2
</grav_deck>
<escape_pod>
100
</escape_pod>
<life_boat>
100
</life_boat>
<crew>
542
</crew>
<passengers>
0
</passengers>
<lithium-fusion>
1
</lithium-fusion>



Now you can create your custom vehicles!  If you want an easy way to
make just tanks (no VTOLs, WiGEs, or wet-naval yet), please try out
