<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="mozTocId899214"></A>Who is Princess Bot?</H2>
<P>The TestBot was originally written several years ago as an example
of how to create an AI for MegaMek.&nbsp; As such, it&rsquo;s not
terribly sophisticated, but it can provide a decent fight when
commanding a handful of Introductory Tech units.&nbsp; It does
odd/silly things with some higher tech units.&nbsp; Also, when
commanding more than a half-dozen units, it slows down exponentially
when attempting to determine which unit to move next.&nbsp; You can
get more details about the TestBot in the ai-readme.txt
document.<BR><BR>The Princess Bot was written many years after in an
attempt to create an AI that would process quicker even if it were
slightly dimmer. Princess offers a few advantages over TestBot.&nbsp;
First, Princess is still being maintained, though not by the original
author.&nbsp; Princess is actually faster at determining which unit
to move next, however, she is slower at moving fast units (VTOLs &amp;
Hovercraft especially).&nbsp; She is able to operate AeroSpace units
on the ground map, which TestBot cannot, but it takes a long time for
her to crunch the numbers and she still can&rsquo;t handle anything
on the space maps.&nbsp; Also, she&rsquo;s not very competent with
Infantry, which she seriously undervalues.&nbsp; One of the biggest
advantages of Princess, however, is that her behavior can be modified
in a number of ways, which you&rsquo;ll see throughout this document.</P>

			<P>The Princess Bot has a number of settings to play
			with.<BR><BR><B>Behavior</B> - There are 4 behaviors
			pre-configured with Princess:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>DEFAULT</I> - Basic
				&quot;balanced&quot; settings. 
				</P>
				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>BERSERK</I> - Highly
				aggressive.&nbsp; Princess will ignore danger to herself and will
				not run away under any circumstances. 
				</P>
				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>COWARDLY</I> - Really
				doesn't want to get shot. 
				</P>
				<LI><P><I>ESCAPE</I> - Not quite as fearful as <I>cowardly</I>
				but she will try to escape from her home board edge ASAP. 
				</P>
			</UL>
			<P><A NAME="Verbosity"></A><B>Verbosity</B> - Used to set the
			level of logging Princess will use.&nbsp; DEBUG mode is <I>very</I>
			verbose.&nbsp; It is recommended you only use it when trying to
			debug something specific.</P>
			<P><B>Forced Withdrawal</B>&nbsp; - Used to make the Princess
			follow the Forced Withdrawal rules outlined in Total Warfare.</P>
			<P><B>Immediate Withdrawal</B> - Used to make Princess send her
			units to her home edge from the start of the game, regardless of
			damage level. This can be handy for <I>Chase</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">and
			</SPAN><I>Breakthrough</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">scenarios.</SPAN></P>
			<P><B>Auto Flee Board</B> - (Only available when <I>Immediate
			Withdrawal</I> is in effect.) If this is checked, Princess will
			issue the Flee command as soon as her units reach her home edge,
			regardless of damage level.</P>
			<P><B>Home Edge</B> - Defines which edge Princess will attempt to
			flee across when Forced Withdrawal is in effect.</P>
			<P><B>Aggression</B> - This determines how much Princess wants to
			close with her enemies.&nbsp; Lower settings will cause her to try
			to keep her distance more, while higher settings will have her get
			right up in her enemies' faces.</P>
			<P><B>Bravery</B> - This determines how much return fire Princess
			is willing to risk in order to do damage to the enemy.</P>
			<P><B>Herding</B> - The higher this value, the more Princess will
			try to keep her units together.</P>
			<P><B>Piloting Caution</B> - This determines how willing Princess
			is to fail a piloting roll and fall on her face when attempting
			various maneuvers.&nbsp; Higher settings means that Princess will
			risk fewer piloting rolls.&nbsp; Note, this also affects how
			willing she is to use MASC or try to move through or on buildings.</P>
			<P><B>Self Preservation</B> - This determines how quickly Princess
			will flee once Forced Withdrawal takes effect.&nbsp; At lower
			levels, she will attempt more of a fighting withdrawal, while at
			higher levels she should run straight for her home edge.</P>
			<P><B>Strategic Targets</B> - This allows you to provide Princess
			with a list of hex coordinates to move to and attack.&nbsp; If a
			building exists in the target hex, then she will attempt to
			destroy that building.</P>

Specifies a saved configuration to be used by Princess. If left out
DEFAULT will be used.<BR>&lt;-v&gt; Specifies the verbosity level
used to log Princess (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR). If left out, ERROR
will be used.<BR>&lt;-p&gt; Specifies the player to be replaced. The
