<H2><A NAME="mozTocId899214"></A>Who is Princess Bot?</H2>

<P>
    The TestBot was originally written several years ago as an example of how to create an AI for MegaMek. As such, it's
    not terribly sophisticated, but it can provide a decent fight when commanding a handful of Introductory Tech units.
    It does odd/silly things with some higher tech units. Also, when commanding more than a half-dozen units, it slows
    down exponentially when attempting to determine which unit to move next. You can get more details about the TestBot
    in the ai-readme.txt document located in the docs folder, then in the Bot Stuff folder.
    <BR>
    <BR>
    The Princess Bot was written many years after in an attempt to create an AI that would process quicker even if it
    were slightly dimmer. Princess offers a few advantages over TestBot. First, Princess is still being maintained,
    though not by the original author. Princess is actually faster at determining which unit to move next, however, she
    is slower at moving fast units (VTOLs &amp; Hovercraft especially). She is able to operate AeroSpace units on the
    ground map, which TestBot cannot, but it takes a long time for her to crunch the numbers, and she still can't handle
    anything on the space maps. Also, she's not very competent with Infantry, which she seriously undervalues. One of
    the biggest advantages of Princess, however, is that her behavior can be modified in a number of ways, which you'll
    see throughout this document.

                The Princess Bot has a number of settings to play with.
                <BR>
                <BR>
                <B>Behavior</B> - There are four behaviors pre-configured with Princess:
            </P>
            <UL>
                <LI><I>DEFAULT</I> - Basic "balanced" settings.
                <LI><I>BERSERK</I> - Highly aggressive. Princess will ignore danger to herself and will not run away
                    under any circumstances.
                <LI><I>COWARDLY</I> - Really doesn't want to get shot.
                <LI><I>ESCAPE</I> - Not quite as fearful as <I>cowardly</I> but she will try to escape from her home
                    board edge ASAP.
            </UL>
            <P>
                You can also enter a name to save your own configurations for later games or for use with the <A
                    HREF="#mozTocId779311">replacePlayer</A> command.
            </P>
            <P>
                <A NAME="Verbosity"></A><B>Verbosity</B> - Used to set the level of logging Princess will use. DEBUG
                mode is <I>very</I> verbose. It is recommended you only use it when trying to debug something specific.
            </P>
            <P>
                <B>Forced Withdrawal</B>&nbsp; - Used to make the Princess follow the Forced Withdrawal rules outlined
                in Total Warfare.
            </P>
            <P>
                <B>Immediate Withdrawal</B> - Used to make Princess send her units to her home edge from the start of
                the game, regardless of damage level. This can be handy for <I>Chase</I> and <I>Breakthrough</I>
                scenarios.
            </P>
            <P>
                <B>Auto Flee Board</B> - (Only available when <I>Immediate Withdrawal</I> is in effect.) If this is
                checked, Princess will issue the Flee command as soon as her units reach her home edge, regardless of
                damage level.
            </P>
            <P>
                <B>Home Edge</B> - Defines which edge Princess will attempt to flee across when Forced Withdrawal is in
                effect.
            </P>
            <P>
                <B>Aggression</B> - This determines how much Princess wants to close with her enemies. Lower settings
                will cause her to try to keep her distance more, while higher settings will have her get right up in her
                enemies' faces.
            </P>
            <P>
                <B>Bravery</B> - This determines how much return fire Princess is willing to risk to do damage to the
                enemy.
            </P>
            <P>
                <B>Herding</B> - The higher this value, the more Princess will try to keep her units together.
            </P>
            <P>
                <B>Piloting Caution</B> - This determines how willing Princess is to fail a piloting roll and fall on
                her face when attempting various maneuvers. Higher settings mean that Princess will risk fewer piloting
                rolls. Note, this also affects how willing she is to use MASC or try to move through or on buildings.
            </P>
            <P>
                <B>Self Preservation</B> - This determines how quickly Princess will flee once Forced Withdrawal takes
                effect. At lower levels, she will attempt more of a fighting withdrawal, while at higher levels she
                should run straight for her home edge.
            </P>
            <P>
                <B>Strategic Targets</B> - This allows you to provide Princess with a list of hex coordinates or unit
                ids to move to and attack. If a building exists in a target hex, then she will attempt to destroy that
                building. If a unit with the given id is on the enemy team, she will give that target a higher priority.
            </P>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="mozTocId779311"></A>Replacing an Absent Player with the Princess Bot</H2>

<P>
    If a player has become disconnected (the word "<I>(ghost)</I>" appears next to their name, you can replace that
    player with a bot. There are two methods for replacing a player. The first is the <i>Edit Bots</i> command under the
    <u>File</u> menu. This will bring up a version of the Bot Config Dialog along with a list of players that can be
    replaced. The second option is to use the <i>/replacePlayer</i> command in the chat window:
</P>
<P>
    <I>/replacePlayer -b:Princess &lt;-c:ConfigName&gt; &lt;-v:VerbosityLevel&gt; &lt;-p:&gt;PlayerName</I>
</P>
<P>
    Princess will replace the named player.
    <BR>
    &lt;-b&gt; Specifies the use of Princess. If left out, TestBot will be used instead.
    <BR>
    &lt;-c&gt; Specifies a saved configuration to be used by Princess (case-sensitive). If left out DEFAULT will be
    used.
    <BR>
    &lt;-v&gt; Specifies the verbosity level used to log Princess (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR). If left out, ERROR will be
    used.
    <BR>
    &lt;-p&gt; Specifies the player to be replaced. The "-p:" is only required with the "-c:" or "-v:" parameters are
    also used.
</P>

<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-after: avoid"><A NAME="Princess-Compatible Optional Rules|outline"></A>Princess-Compatible
    Optional Rules</H2>

<P>
    The following are the optional rules that should be safe to use when playing against Princess. Anything not on this
    list will either cause Princess to behave in nonsensical ways (always Sprinting or Leaping) or can cause
    crashes/lockups (mek/vehicle lance movement). So, it is not recommended you use any rules not on this list when
    using Princess.
