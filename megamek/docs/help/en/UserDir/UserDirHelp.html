<H1>How to Use the User Data Directory</H1>
<P>
    Use this directory for resources you want to share between different installations or versions of MegaMek,
    MegaMekLab and MekHQ. The files listed below will also be loaded from this directory (in addition to what is loaded
    from MegaMek's own data). The directory should be an absolute path such as D:/MyBTStuff (in other words, not
    relative to your MegaMek directory).
</P>
<P>
    Generally, all content from the user directory is added to the pre-defined content. In some cases, added content may
    replace pre-defined content when it has the same name or file path.

    How to place files within the user data directory:
</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
        <B>Fonts</B> can be placed anywhere in the user data directory (i.e., in the directory itself or in any
        subfolder)
    </LI>
    <LI>
        <B>Units</B> (.mtf and .blk files) can be placed anywhere in the user data directory
    </LI>
    <LI>
        <B>Camo</B> images must be placed in <code>{user data directory}/data/images/camo/</code>. In this subfolder,
        further subfolders can be used (optional).
    </LI>
    <LI>
        <B>Portrait</B> images must be placed in <code>{user data directory}/data/images/portraits/</code>. In this
        subfolder, further subfolders can be used (optional).
    </LI>
    <LI>
        <B>Unit fluff</B> images must be placed in <code>{user data directory}/data/images/fluff/{unit type}/</code>. To
        find the exact subfolders to use, go to your megamek folder and open <code>/data/images/fluff/</code>.
    </LI>
    <LI>
        <B>Skin</B> definition files (.xml) can be placed anywhere in the user data directory
    </LI>
    <LI>
        <B>Rank Systems</B> may be defined in <code>{user data directory}/data/universe/ranks.xml</code>
    </LI>
    <LI>
        <B>Award</B> definition files (.xml) can be placed in <code>{user data directory}/data/universe/awards</code>
    </LI>
</UL>

<P>
    Additionally, the user directory is used to restore your most recent session in MegaMekLab. If you set the startup
    mode of MML to "Restore Tabs," a hidden folder called ".mml_tmp" will be created in your user directory. You should
    not touch this folder. Changing the contents of this folder may cause MML to fail to start. If you have "Restore
    Tabs" set and MML is failing to start, try deleting the ".mml_tmp" folder, in case it was corrupted somehow.
