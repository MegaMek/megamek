<P>
    The skin specifications for MegaMek can be found in <code>mmconf/defaultSkin.xml</code>.
</P>
<P>
    The schema for this XML file can be found in <code>mmconfg/skinSchema.xls</code>.
</P>
<P>
    Skin specifications consist of multiple <code>UI_Element</code> tags which consist of a name, a border
    specification, and zero or more <code>background_image</code> tags. The name identifies which UI elements this skin
    specification applies to. The <code>defaultButton</code> and <code>defaultElement</code> specifications are special
    in that they are used to specify the skin for any unspecified <code>MegamekButton</code> and any UI component that
    uses a <code>MegamekBorder</code> but doesn't have an explicit <code>UI_element</code> tag.
</P>
<P>
    Border tags define what images are used in the border for the UI component. Currently, there are eight possible
    images: four corners, and four images that go in between the corners. The images that go in between corners are
    referred to as edges. The image below illustrates these: each corner is highlighted in green and each edge is
    highlighted in red.
