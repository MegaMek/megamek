<H1>How to custom Megamek Skins</H1>
<P>
    The skin specifications for Megamek can be found in <code>mmconf/defaultSkin.xml</code>. The schema for this XML
    file can be found in <code>mmconfg/skinSchema.xls</code>. Skin specifications consist of multiple UI_Element tags
    which consist of a name, a border specification, and zero or more background_image tags. The name identifies which
    UI elements this skin specification applies to. The <code>defaultButton</code> and <code>defaultElement</code>
    specifications are special in that they are used to specify the skin for any unspecified <code>MegamekButton</code>
    and any UI component that uses a <code>MegamekBorder</code> but doesn't have an explicit UI_element tag.
</P>
<P>
    Border tags define what images are used in the border for the UI component. Currently, there are 8 possible images:
    four corners, and four images that go in between the corners. The images that go in between corners are referred to
    as edges. The image below illustrates these: each corner is highlighted in green and each edge is highlighted in
    red.

    Additionally, the two background images for buttons are illustrated.
