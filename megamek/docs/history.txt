    function allows the user to replace multiple ghost players through the selection window on the left side

+ Modified the random crater generation routine as the existing routine was not honoring min/max crater radius and was
    sometimes creating hills rather than craters.
+ Princess will now be pickier about firing ammo-using weapons as their bins run dry.  The less ammo she has, the
    better she'll want her to-hit odds to be before firing.  Ammo conservation depends on a combination of total
    shots remaining and aggressiveness (higher aggression means less conservation).
+ Data: Unit Fixes and New Images.
+ Data: Fixed Scenario files to be inline with new naming system.
+ Bug: VGLs mounted in the front right and front left on vehicles would receive
    a 'not in arc' message without TO vehicle arc rules on

+ Bug: Fixed mine dispensers to work according with rules in TO p.325
+ Bug [#4234]: Missiles/Artillery couldn't be directed to make a mine clearance
    attacks
+ Princess will no longer attack Crippled units when the Forced Withdrawal rule is turned on.  However, if a fleeing
    unit fires on one of her units, the controlling player is flagged as 'dishonored' and his units will become
    regular targets again.  Likewise, the Priority Targets list overrides this new behavior.
+ If Forced Withdrawal is turned on Princess's Crippled units will no longer fire as they attempt to retreat unless
    they are fired on first.  Also, firing on such a unit, will get the attacking player flagged as 'dishonored'.
+ Princess now de-prioritizes civilian units until they fire on one of her units or unless they are on the Priority
    Targets list.
+ Bug [#4234]: Implemented Mine clearance manipulators for BA
+ Bug [#4177]: VTOLs not crashing with killed crew critical

v0.39.1 (2014-08-26 14:56 UTC)
+ Patch [#458]: Highlighting FOV options
+ Patch [#462]: Forcing redirected system.out and sys.err to respect flush
+ Data: New Images and some date fixes
+ Added entity attribute neverDeployed to the MUL files
+ Bug [#4189] Princess throws NPE (in exp branch)
+ Feature [#1269]: Allow changing button order for phase displays
+ Feature: Added an FPS counter that is toggleable via advanced options
+ Data: Unit Fixes and New Images.
+ Data: New Images.
+ Data: Starting to change Source Names to match TRO for easier reference.
+ Bug [#4193]: Princess NPE: Exception in thread "Packet Pump"
    java.lang.NullPointerException
+ Feature: Added the font_color attribute to the UI_Element tag in skin specs
+ Feature: Plain skin; now if an icon for a border or button fails to load, the
    element falls back to the paintComponent method of its parent, which enables
    a plain skin to be specified by leaving out all icons.
+ Feature: Added ability to select a skin specification file in  the client
    settings dialog.  Note: this only takes effect before a game is started
+ Feature: SkinSpecification/MegamekBorder now supports a no border mode
+ Feature: SkinSpec/MegamekButton now supports scaled background images in
    addition to tiled ones
+ Bug [#4190]: Nova/Watchdog CEWS projects a 6 hex ECM field instead of 3
+ Data: New Images,Unit Fixes, and RAT fixes
+ Bug [#4199]: Movement impossible due to infinite recursion/stack overflow
+ Better error handling for skin selection: in the client dialog it will check
    to see if the skin file failed to load and if so notify the user and reinit
    the old skin.  Error logging for failed parsing is also better.  Finally,
    if a SkinSpecification is requested when no SkinSpec is initialized, a
    default value is returned that will effectively force a "plain" skin.
+ Refactored BoardView1 to move it to its own package and refactored a lot of
    inner classes to their own classes/files.
+ Rewrote BoardView1.drawMinefields(): now instead of iterating through all
    visible coords, it iterates through all mined coords and checks to see if
    they are visible.
+ Adjusted default values for ADVANCED_KEY_REPEAT_DELAY and
    ADVANCED_KEY_REPEAT_RATE
+ Bug [#4196]: Princess Fires on Crew Killed Vehicles
+ Bug [#4203]: Poor indication when aeros are low or out of fuel

    options
+ Data: New Images

    Longest path finder + fixed bug with jump movement envelope.
+ Bug [#4204]: Game.addEntity allows adding of duplicate Entity IDs
+ Feature: Added maximal movement modifiers envelope.
+ Bug: movement envelope and movement modifiers sprites not scaling when
    changing zoom levels
+ Data: New Images and some equipment date/name fixes.
+ Fix: Faster path finding for aeros on ground.(Longest path still takes >20sec)
+ Data: New Images
+ Feature: Smarter path finding for Princess
+ Data: New Images
+ Bug: Princess violates stacking restrictions
+ Bug: Windows does not allow double quotes in filenames, so fluff images for
    any unit that has a model using them will not work. Fixed by stripping the
    double quotes from the models of such units, allowing the filenames to be
    exact without them. Example:
    Unit: Grasshopper GHR-7K "Gravedigger"
    Fluff Filename: Grasshopper GHR-7K Gravedigger.gif
+ Data: New Images and some unit fixes. Includes additional wreck images.
+ Data: New Images and fix for bug [#4209]
+ Bug: Added a new game event: GameVictoryEvent, which has a corresonding
    GameListener.gameVictory method.  This event is called when the
    PHASE_VICTORY is ending, but before Game.reset is called.  This fixes a bug
    with MekHQ (and likely MekWars as well)
+ Bug: NPE in princess precognition when after a mechwarrior is picked by a mech
+ Data: New Images
+ PlayerSettingsDialog now displays the name of the player being configured
+ Server sends a chat to all players when a player changes their player-wide
    initiative bonus
+ PlayerSettingsDialog can now be accessed mid-game so that players can adjust
    their settings, like player-wide initiative bonus.  This is to help support
    conditional initiative bonuses, like in Total Chaos

+ Bug: Ortho graphic icons (bridges) drawn too low when on negative elevation
+ Bug: Princess.die could throw an NPE
+ Bug: CustomMechDialog getNextEntity(boolean) returning entities for other players
    From a discussion with Arlith, we decided that perhaps this was intended if no
    blind drop options are on. However, we also decided to limit it to the units
    owned by the player of the currently displayed units so that you will only
    cycle through the entities of one player at a time
+ Bug: BattleMaster BLR-1G and "chassis" not working quite right due to misnamed
    files
+ Bug: NPE in MtfFile.java when the file that is being parsed is empty
+ Feature [#1158]: Map Editor: Re-size maps
+ Refactored Compute.get*ECMFieldSize() methods to be cleaner and a bit more
    efficient
+ Updated Game to cache which Coords have Entitys in them, and what those
    Entitys are.  Now Game.getEntities(Coords) uses the cache to return much
    quicker.  This is important for games with a large number of Entitys, as
    Game.getEntities(Coords) can be called frequently (like when computing LoS)
+ Bug: View -> Round Report was displaying the phase report for the current
    round instead of the round report
+ Bug [#4215]: Long delays between turns for large battles with
    double-blind/sensors

+ Bug [#4226]: Long delays between phases for large battles with
    double-blind/sensors
+ Bug: NPE when selecting C3 choices for masters in unit customization dialog
+ Bug: Loading a MUL file with specified C3 networks caused doubling or slave
    Entities, and C3 networks were not connected
+ Bug: Compute.inVisualRange wasn't considering SO Advanced AA fire
+ Bug [#4228]: VTOLs Invalid Targets for ASF on Map
+ Bug: updated ECM drawing code to not draw EC(C)M fields for transported units
    (according to current errata)
+ Bug [#4227]: VTOL Turrets do not show in MM Unit Display
+ Feature [#1279]: Introduction of custom quirks file
+ Data: New Images
+ Added the following new quirks: Battle Fists, Overhead Arms, Compact Mech, Low-Mounted Arms, Oversized and
    Static Ammo Feed.  None of these are coded yet, they are purely display values only.  Also updated the
    cannonUnitQuirks.xml file to include these new quirks
+ Feature Request [features:#1265] Princess Bot and magma
+ Added code to make Princess fire hole-punchers before crit-seekers
+ Added new unofficial option to ignore TW pg. 109 rules requiring primary targets being in front arc
+ Bug: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Princess's PathRanker.validatePaths()
    if the list of paths to validate is empty to begin with

    vehicular grenade launchers)
+ Feature: Vehicular grenade launchers now report as auto-hits
+ Bug: Fixed stack overflow with UI automatic target code
+ Added support for a new Smoke type: Chaff, to be used for VGL chaff grenades
+ Refactored code relating to SmokeCloud, including replacing magic numbers with
    static final values in SmokeCloud
+ Bug: Princess FireControl was using the smoke level directly to compute to-hit
    penalties, since smoke level doesn't directly correspond to light/heavy,
    this wasn't quite accurate.  Fixed the code and expanded the firecontrol
    unit tests to incorporate tests for other smoke levels
+ Bug: data/images/hexs/trasparent/lismoke.png should be lismokes.gif
+ Updated hex tilesets to include a chaff icon, just used light smoke icon as a
    placeholder
+ Bug: Communications equipment always generating ECCM, regardless of mode
+ More support for Chaff: chaff now considered as ECM that effects all players
+ Server now updates client's list of smoke clouds: added a new packet type,
    this is required because chaff type SmokeClouds generate ECM, which the
    client needs to know about
+ ECMInfo now supports having a null owner, which indicates that it should
    always be considered as coming from an enemy
+ Feature [#1281]: Implement vehicular grenade launcher ammo functionality
+ Updated VGL Ammo names, default ammo name has Fragmentation in it
+ Changed UnitDisplay so that the ammo dropdown displays the name of the ammo

    except for cluster munitions on LB-X's (can only use cluster), and artemis
    capable munitions for Artemis-linked launchers.  NARC, MMLs and ATMs are
    exempt

+ Bug: startup.sh not properly handling documentation: it would symlink the data
    directory and copy over the readme's.  The readme's moved to the docs dir,
    but this behavior would break all of the other docs.  I added code to
    symlink the docs directory in the same fashion as the data dir.

+ Feature Request [#1188]: RATs calling other RATs.  Added code to recognize the
    "@" symbol as a reference to anther RAT to roll on.  Updated the EXAMPLE RAT
    FILE.txt file to reflect this information and also copied it into the docs
    folder to make it easier to find.
+ Added a basic moral system for Princess to have her potentially retreat units
    off the board before Forced Withdrawal would take effect.
+ Updated the Xotl RAT files to incorporate the most recent version (including
    the 3050 IS mechs) and to make use of the changes for Feature Request

    (notably not physical ones).
+ Refactoring: MechWarrior has new superclass EjectedCrew (derived in turn from
    Infantry) in order to better distinguish between them all.

    least one NPE).

    suppress underlying divide-by-zero issue)
+ Bug [#4122]: New fix for this bug that allows Princess.isImmobilized to count
    move 0 non-infantry units as immobilized.  Also added additional protection
    against a 1/0 error in Princess.calculateMoveIndex.
+ Errata: Vehicle-mounted chemical lasers not disabled by engine hits
    (tentatively also extended to heavy/vehicle flamers on a "makes sense" basis
    pending further clarification).

+ Bug: Destroying a location with a Narc/iNarc pod attached negates its benefits
    in mid-damage resolution; should last until end of phase (TW pp. 138/9).
+ Errata: Units with active stealth armor have no ECM 'bubble'.
+ Errata: Vehicular jump jet motive damage checks ignore TacOps vehicle
    effectiveness.
+ Errata: AES BV increase for linked weapons reduced from 50% to 25%.
+ Bug: SB Gauss weight counted towards targeting computer (incorrect as per the
    weapon's construction rules on TacOps p. 314).
+ Data: New Images

+ Removed code to dispose of RandomUnitGenerator, since it no longer takes up
    so much memory (also required to reinforce from the RandomArmyDialog)

+ Bug: FoV darkening: when considered LoS between a selected unit and another
    unit, the location of the selected unit was being used to determine the
    elevation of the target, leading to incorrect calculations
+ Bug: fall elevation was improperly computed when doing displacement
+ Bug: PlayerListDialog was never updating the player list, also adjusted the
    formatting and added team information

    also does not parse streams that do have unit tags as root elements
    instead of just an entity tag
+ Bug [#4082]: Clan Bonus Description on Random Skill Selection Pannel
+ Bug [#4081]: Field of View in Depth 1 Water Hex
+ Bug [#408]: (clan) showing in mechview not based on actual techlevel, but on
 internal name
+ Bug: Could not save a board image in isometric view
+ Bug: Saving board image with FoV tool on would cause a hex to be highlighted

    directory, potentially resulting in build failures.
+ Data: New Images.
+ Data: Lots of Unit Names Changes this is to bring us closer to matching the MUL naming.

v0.37.9-exp (2014-03-29 14:25 UTC)
+ Bug [#4016]: "More" Button gets grayed out with aeros 0.37.6-exp
+ Bug: Go Up and Maneuver buttons were not being disabled for OOC Aeros
+ Bug: Fixed graphical artefacts on edges of map on non-isometric view,
    unfortunately this required removing the optimization code that caches the
    board image and allows for faster updates with isometric view.
+ Removed the rest of the code related to caching the board image
+ Added code to BoardView1 to buffer the drawing of the tiled background image,
    which reduces the amount of time it takes to draw by an order of magnitude
+ Added some missing l10n entries for MovementDisplay
+ Added padding to the top and side of the board

v0.37.9, 0.38.0 Release Candidate 1 (2014-03-29 14:25 UTC)

+ Added a 'guess' paramter to the various WeaponFireInfo constructors to
    indicate when the to hit chance should be
    estimated rather than fully calculated.
+ Changed the FireControl.checkGuess... methods to only run when Princess is in
    debug mode.
+ Updated the Princess help doc with a list of Optional Rules that should be
    safe to use.
+ Bug [#4058]: Movement Report Dialogue needs a scrollbar
+ Refactored PhysicalInfo class and added unit tests for it.
+ Refactored FireControl.calculateUtility and added unit tests for it.
+ Added additional considerations for ground to air attacks in Princess's
    'guess to hit' methods.
+ Feature: Added support for Clan Exoskeletons without harjel: BattleArmor has
    a new state variable to track this, and TestBattleArmor.getWeightStructure
    properly supports it
+ Bug: Armored Gloves weren't properly being counted as AP Mounts for purposes
    of BattleArmor validation
+ Bug [#4051]: Facing when 'Mech skids: ver 0.37.8-Exp

+ Bug [#4055]: allow constructing BA with Modular Equipment Adaptor
+ Bug [#4064]: Inability to fire at secondary targets when attacking things with
    stealth armor. (also made some code formatting changes)
+ Bug: MechDisplay was using Mech.isChameleonShieldActive() instead of
    Mech.isChameleonShieldOn() to determine if a CLPS is generating heat.
+ Bug [#3675]: Infantry mods for Chameleon LPS
+ Bug [#3806]: Another double-blind related bug

    it should have been using CriticalSlot.getMount(), which was causing issues
    when exploding inferno ammo from heat
+ Fixed a ClassCastException in PhysicalInfo.initDamage()
+ Added code for Princess to give command units a higher targeting priority.
    Princess defines 2 levels of command unit: Commander and Sub-Commander.  A
    Commander is any unit with the isCommander flag set, has a C3 Master system
    or provides the highest initiative bonus for its player.  A Sub-Commander
    is any unit that has an init bonus (but not the highest), a C3 slave system,
    ECM, Active Probe, TAG, EI Cockpit or is currently using a spotlight.
+ Bug [#2244]: ECM in Double Blind games -> wrong hit roll reporting
+ Bug [#3996]: Cleaned up a few more areas where not all of an Entitys loaded
    units were being sent to Clients during updates
+ Bug: Firing solutions was always drawing data for teammate units, even if
    friendly fire was off, also wouldn't draw friendly units that weren't
    visible to an enemy unit
+ Bug [#4070]: Specialty BA not working when BA carried by mech.
+ Bug: No report when mechanized BA avoid damage
+ Bug: Reports for mechanized BA taking/avoiding damage are not indented well

    when BoardView1.localPlayer == null
+ Bug [#4069]: Estevez MBT & Estevez AA Customize Issue
+ Changed the commander/subcommander weighting mod from a multipler to a
    straight adder.
+ Added code to increase the target priority of buildings on the Strategic
    Targets list.
+ Bug: Fixed a bug introduced in [r10660] (when fixing [#2244]): the code to
    determine if an entity should be drawn was using isEverSeenByEnemy instead
    of isVisibleToEntity
+ Bug: Los darkening for sensor ranges was using a >= comparison for min sensor
    range instead of >.  The min range is not inclusive as witnessed in
    Compute.inSensorRange
+ Bug [#4068]: In double-blind, units detected by sensors only should not be
    aware
+ Added the ability to add enemy units to Princess's Strategic Targets list.
    Units on this list will be weighted about the same as sub-commander's
    (though a unit could be both a commander/sub-commander and a strategic
    target for an even higher weighting).  This should (hopefully) prove useful
    for escort and headhunting type missions.
+ Bug [#4072]: Entity sprites "blinking" out of drawing since revisions after
    r10659.
+ Bug: Changing the AP weapon mounted would cause a crash when starting the game
    (I had to change Entity.getTotalWeaponList to return the actual list and
    not a copy, which appeared to not be necessary)
+ Bug: Changing ammo type on BA would change the number of shots selected
+ Bug [#3999]: Renamed all .MTF to .mtf
+ Bug [#4063]: Mixed Tech MASC verification failure
+ Bug [#3999]: Renamed all .BLK to .blk
+ Data: New Images and Units.  Fixes to RATs.
+ Bug: Tanks with stunned crews could spot for indirect fire
+ Bug [#3672]: Starting a scenario resets all game options to default
+ Fixed an issue with Princess attempting impossible physical attacks.
+ Bug [#3669]: Random Names bad encoding (major refactorization of MUL parsing)
+ Bug: Reading in bomb choices from a MUL file threw an
    ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:  bomb types were saved as numbers but were
    being parsed as names
+ Bug: MUL files weren't saving velocity and altitude information for Aeros
+ Bug: Antipersonel Mount and Modular Equipment Mount changes via the
    CustomMechDialog were not saved in the MUL file
+ Bug: EntityListFile.getLocString was using Entity.getArmorForReal and
    BattleArmor.getOArmor to make armor comparisons at the squad level: one will
    return -1  and the other will return 0.  Added code to make the propr
    comparisons for BA
+ Fixed the Random Map Generation dialog to see folders as well as "*.xml" files
    without having to switch to "all" files.
+ Fix of the previous fix of the Random Map Generation dialog (been too long
    since I last worked with a FileChooser).
+ Bug: Server.damageCrew will no damage the crew if they are dead, doomed or
    ejected.  This can lead to circumstances were the user might not be aware of
    why no damage was dealt.  New reports why the crew didn't take damage.
+ Bug [#4073]: NPE on unit loading in MM, Think its something with Armortype
+ Bug: vehicle_threshold is considered for rolls of 2, 8, and 12 with turrets
    for the automatic critical from rolling those locations, however it was
    *not* being considered for rolls of 12 without turrets.
+ Bug [#4074]: Superheavy vees ignore Vehicle Damage Thresholds rule
+ Bug: SuperHeavyTanks with dual turrets can never have the second turret hit
+ Bug: Path planner could get stuck searching forever: there's code that fires
    every 256 loop iterations to check for timeout, however it only checks for
    timeout if the current best path is better than the previous best path.
+ Rebuilt the Random Map Generation dialog from the ground up to improve it's organization and work flow.  Added
    tool tips explaining the various fields and eliminated the need to save and exit the dialog before switching
    from Normal to Advanced view.  Did not update the German or Russian messages.properties files as I'm not
    nearly qualified.
+ Data: New Images and Some unit fixes.
+ Bug: [#4076] Princess Not Using Ammo Properly.
+ Princess wasn't properly storing the new Priority Unit targets.  Also modified
    the path ranking process to prevent her from wasting time chasing down
    ejected pilots/crews.
+ Bug [#4075]: Silver Bullet Gauss Rifle can aim locations
+ Bug [#4077]: BA with individual missile launchers attack as if the entire
    squad is armed
+ Bug [#4078]: Selected entity doesn't get cleared from FiringDisplay when
    using /reset
+ Feature [#1236]: Increase maximum player limit
+ Bug [#3088]: BA compact narc not correct

v0.37.8-exp (2014-02-22 22:57 UTC)
+ Feature: Added the ability to specify the anti-aliasing rendering hint for the
    drawing in BoardView1.  The usage of anti-aliasing is parameterized in the
    client settings dialog.  This smooths out the lines a bit without a
    noticeable impact on performance (but again, it's parameterized).

v0.37.8 (2014-02-22 22:57 UTC)
+ Added state variable Entity.neverDeployed and new method for it boolean
    Entity.wasNeverDeployed()
+ Feature Request [#1224] Princess stop chasing the Fighters!
    Also modified the code for finding the nearest enemy to assume that unmoved
    units will move away.
+ Added some more BA Equipment, prevent Support Weapons from being added to
    mounts, and some unit fixes
+ Adjusted TestBattleArmor: AP Mounts are now counted as AP weapons, instead of
    InfantryWeapons.  This is because, each AP Mount has the potential to have
    an AP weapon in it.  It also matches the current TM errata.
+ TestBattleArmor now considers unallocated infantry weapons to be illegal
+ Feature: BLK encoding now adds the :APM tag for AP Mounted weapons
+ TestBattleArmor was improperly counting APM mounted Infantry weapons as
    unallocated
+ APM related bugs in MechFileParser
+ Tweaked Herd Mentality values again as Princess still shows a tendency to
    spread out too much when running a mix of fast and slow units.
+ Bug [#4006]: Facing after fall while moving was wrong
+ show damage level should be a client setting, not a game option
+ Bug [#4040]: Unable to match AP weapon mount for BA 0.37.8-dev

+ Updated TestBattleArmor to give weight reductions for ammo in DWPs and also to
    not consider ammo mounted in DWPs as unallocated
+ Fixed Centaur BA to mount BA Tube Artillery ammo in the DWP
+ Updated support for squad support weapon mounts on BA: there is now a state
    variable in Mounted, squadSupportWeapon, which has a getter and setter.
    Mounteds that are squad support mounted have reduced weight, and weapons
    that are squad support mounted only get 1 hit
+ Squad Support Weapons on BA now cannot fire if Trooper 1 is dead
+ Updated Mounted.getDesc() to include tags for AP Mounted weapons and Squad
    Support Weapon Mounts
+ TestBattleArmor: quad BA with SSWM's are now illegal
+ Bug [#3996]: Entity.getLoadedUnits can return a collection with null entries
+ Bug [#4043]: 0.37.7 Battle armor Reflective/Reactive armor & UMU BV
+ Bug [#4039]: Princess doesn't attempt to stand a 'mech 0.37.7
+ Bug [#4042]: Crew Dead
+ Bug: Entity.getMovementModeAsString returns "UMU" for INF_UMU, but
    BLKBattleArmorFile expects motion_type to be "submarine" for BA with UMUs.
    Fixed this by changing BLKBattleArmorFile to "UMU"
+ Renamed a lot of the BA weapons and equipment to remove the BA infront of
    their names.
+ Data: LOT of BA blk file changes.
+ Bug: Aero Side-slips could only be performed if they expended all of the
    velocity (was using the wrong method to check for validity)
+ Bug: Aero Side-slips were improperly giving the -1 modifier to ASF's, it
    should only go to Conventional Fighters with VSTOL
+ Bug: MovementDisplay was not setting the selected entity to null when a
    player's turn is ended, which lead to the FOV darkening code darkening the
    FOV from the perspective of the unit just moved before it was moved
+ Feature: Added PSR nag for ejecting from a 'mech
+ Added a VTOL_MAX_ROTOR_ARMOR define to TestTank, which is currently set to 2
+ Data: Unit and RAT fixes.
+ Data: Unit fixes and new unit images.
+ Feature [#1229]: Move Multiple Mechs
+ Bug: Report spacing fix: there are now newlines after each weapon firing
    report and also in between different unit firing reports
+ Bug: Shooting LRMs at infantry caused some weird new lines in the report:
    you would see something like 12 missile(s) hit \n hits men.
+ Bug: Forgot to add l10n entries for Mek Lance Movement
+ Bug: Mek Lance Movement is technically unofficial, options now relfects this
+ Feature [#1181]: Show armored components
+ Feature [#1119]: Arrange Map Sizes
+ Refactored FireControl.guessToHitModifierPhysical and added unit tests for it.
+ Bug [#3942]: Initiative ties not rolled off when multiple ties

    lance movement rules
+ Bug [#3933]: mech that fails getting up after falling in basement ends up at
    wrong elevation

    Fighters On
+ Bug: Server.crashVTOLorWiGE(7) had an off-by-one error for the facing table
+ Bug [#4006]: hit table when crashing during skid
+ Bug [#4049]: No unit to move error with Meks move as a lance
+ Bug [#4048]: Ejected units have no cause of destruction at end of game report
+ Added Clan PPC Capacitor
+ Adjusted default player colors: yellow and white are now at the end, as they
    aren't very readable
+ Data: New Image and Units. Unit and Equipment Date Fixes.

v0.37.7-exp (2014-02-11 02:57 UTC)

v0.37.7 (2014-02-11 02:57 UTC)
+ Added code to Princess to not compute a full firing plan if a target is out
    or range or out of LoS.  This should hopefully speed up her path ranking a
    little bit.
+ Bug [#4013]: TSM and leg destroyed - version 0.37.6-MW-r10432
+ Bug [#4024] Cruise Missile Ammo misnamed
+ Bug [#4023]  Cruise Missile Launcher/Ammo different Tech Levels.

+ Data: Commits to address [#3999].  This will taking multiple commits to fix.
+ Bug [#4011] Military Space Stations not turning correctly
+ Data: Unit Stuff
+ Bug: Changes to BA armor.
+ Bug: Updates to TestBattleArmor: isMountLegal wasn't counting squad
    equipment, and it wasn't properly counting crits for spreadable mounts
+ Bug [#4029]: Bot hangs on killshot 0.37.7-dev
+ Bug: Clan BA use a <Point Equipment> tag while IS BA use <Squad Equipment>,
    since the location abbreviations are different.  MML uses the location
    abbreviations when writing the tags, however the BA BLK reader was always
    looking for <Squad Equipment>.  This has been changed so that the BLK reader
    will look for the proper tag name based on tech type.  Note: this *will*
    break Clan BA that use <Squad Equipment> tags.
+ Bug: TestBattleArmor wasn't accounting for free MP when computing BA weight
+ Data: Changes to Clan Battle Armor tags.
+ Bug: Updated max MP tracking methods in BattleArmor to account for equipment
+ Implemented TestBattleArmor and updated EntityVerifier to verify BattleArmor
+ Bug [#4027]: Setting Number of Components to Search

+ Added Entity.addCritical(int, CriticalSlot, int) that allows a CriticalSlot
    to be added to a specific slot number (before it could only be done to the
    first empty slot)
+ Updated Mech.addEquipment(Mounted, int, boolean): now there is
    Mech.addEquipment(Mounted, int, boolean, int) which adds a Mounted to the
    location in the specific critical slot. The previous method calls this one
    with a CriticalSlot of 0
+ Data: New Images
+ Changed Name in MANIPULATOR_TYPE_STRINGS to match Internal Names in MiscType.
+ Added tag to BA Manipulators.
+ Feature: TestBattleArmor now checks validity of manipulators on BA
+ Bug: Clan BA Reactive and Reflective armor had the wrong internal name.
    They also both specified duplicate additional lookup names.
+ Bug: IS BA Reactive and Reflective armor had the wrong internal name.
+ Added code to MechView so that BA armors don't show in equipment

+ Updated TestBattleArmor to ensure that a BA with jump boosters has jump MP
+ Updated TestBattleArmor to ensure that a BA with a partial wing has jump MP
+ BattleArmor used to set armor by adding it as equipment.  This is no longer
    the case and the code that allows this has been removed.
+ Moved Popup mines to BA weapons folder.
+ New Images.
+ Bug: BA Myomer booster cost wasn't being calculated correctly
+ Bug [#4010]: Line break issue with stealth armor that stops functioning
+ Bug [#4006]: Facing after fall
+ Updates for BA one-shot ammo: Added a convenience method to Mounted that
    returns true if the Mounted is for a OS launcher, made it so ammo linked to
    an OS launcher doesn't show in the MechView, and also made it so ammo
    linked to an OS launcher doesn't get saved to BLK files
+ Bug: TestBattleArmor wasn't being used in all of the places it should be, now
    it is used wherever TestMech, TestTank, and TestAero are
+ Bug: TestBattleArmor weight reporting was off (it was BattleArmor.getWeight()
    to determine the max weight for the squad, which returns the number of
    troopers)
+ Bug: DetachableWeaponsPack MiscType for Clan and IS had criticals of 0
    instead of 1
+ Data: First round of BA fixes (There are still errors in here)
+ Bug [#4014]: Conventional Aeros Building Up Heat 0.37.6-exp
+ Data: First round of BA fixes (There are still errors in here)
+ Data: Next Round of BA Unit fixes.
+ Changes in BA Weapons/Misc Type/Ammo Type for the new units.
+ Bug [#4035]: MegaMek hangs when firing Thumper Cannon 0.37.7-dev
+ TestBattleArmor now checks to make sure each slot of ammo has at most 4 shots
+ BA Fixes
+ Bug: TestBattleArmor wasn't dealing with slot assignments for BA OS ammo
+ Bug: TestBattleArmor wasn't dealing with slot assignments for equipmeint
    mounted in DWP's (the equipment in the DWP would fail validation because
    it was considered unallocatd equipment)
+ BattleArmor with AP Mounts and Armored gloves no longer get automatically
    assigned an infantry autorifle
+ Bug [#4019]: BA that specify AP weapons in the datafile should not get an
    infantry auto rifle automatically
+ Feature: BattleArmor with an AP Mount or Armored glove can now configure what,
    if any, anti-personnel weapon is mounted
+ Bug: Selecting # of shots for BattleArmor was bugged in CustomMechDialog
+ Feature: CustomMechDialog now verifiers entities after customization, when
    applicable
+ Data: BA Unit Fixes
+ Feature: Added a way to specify if a weapon in a BLK file is mounted in an AP
    mount.  This works the same way as DWP's: the weapon entry in the BLK file
    needs to have an :AWP tag added to it.  Added a new state to Mounted,
    isAWPMounted along with a getter and setter.  MechFileParser.postLoadInit
    was updated to link AP Mounts with APM Mounted equipment in the same loc.
+ Bug [#4026]: Intermittent Vehicle Attack Issue with tacops vehicle crews game
    option
+ Data: More BA Unit Fixes
+ Bug [#4038]: Magscan option missing popup description 0.37.7-dev
+ Bug [#4037]: A bunch of units showing up under the weight class
    "Ultra Light/PA(L)/Exoskeleton 0.37.7-dev
+ Bug: BattleArmor weight classes weren't working properly in MechSelectorDialog
    MechSummary.getTons() was changed to return the number of troopers for BA
    to give a better idea of how much storage spaces was required for the squad
    This created issues and required the MechSummary to keep track of suit
    weight for BattleArmor
+ Bug: For some reason BA with InfantryAutoRifle were having that piece of
    equipment fail to load.  I replaced InfantryAutoRifle with
    InfantryAssaultRifle and the equipment now loads


v0.37.6-exp (2014-01-29 01:43 UTC)
+ Added new art assets for borders and updated the defaultSkin.xml to use them
+ Testing out some changes to BoardView1.  Instead of just drawing a gray
    background for the board, it now draws a tiled icon.  This works for
    isometric view but is still not working for non-iso.  Also, to deal with
    transparency on the borders, I added a background icon to the scrollpane
    that houses the board view.
+ To facilitate having a background icon for the board view, the size of the
    BoardView1 component has been changed.  Now, it is set to match the window
    size and the ClientGUI implements the ComponentListener interface to update
    the BoardView1 component size when the window is resized.
+ Updated the background icon code for BV1, it now loads them from the skin spec
    (background[0] for the tiled icon, background[0] for the transparency
    background).  It also is robust to not having an icon loaded.
+ Bug: Note icon wasn't being initialized, so it didn't appear on the board
+ Bug: I noticed sometimes the scrolling keys (WASD) didn't seem to be
    responding and toggling the ChatterBox would fix this.  I'm guessing this
    has to due with the state of BoardView1.chatterBoxActive getting out of
    sync.  To fix this, added code in ClientGUI to set the chatterbox to active
    whenever the phase is changed.  I this should help, but I don't know if it
    definitely fix it or not.
+ Bug: Hotkeys were still active when various dialos in the File menu were open
+ UnitOverview now draws in the upper right corner regardless of board size
+ Bug: Fixed an issue with not being able to scroll across the whole board
+ Bug: Registered CommandActions in MegaMekController were never being
    unregistered, which mean that if multiple games were started from the same
    MegaMek instance, the keybinds wouldn't always work right.  Now, in
    ClientGUI.die() all of the registered actions are removed.

v0.37.6 (2014-01-29 01:43 UTC)
+ Bug [#4009]: Bomb Rack/Micro Bomb allows bombing from higher terrain
+ Bug: wrong elevation when displacing onto negative elevation terrain
+ Bug: wrong elevation when assault dropping onto non-elevation 0 terrain
+ Bug: wrong elevation after DFAing on non-elevation 0 terrain
+ Data: Unit Fix and some Camo Folder Reorganization and additions included Naval Schemes.
+ Feature: Naval Mass Driver Implemented.  FR 2765 Units added.
+ Bug: Bad lookup names Single Hex ECM causing NPE on Small Craft
+ Bug: Building basement reports (2111,2112) have no subject, but weren't public
+ Bug: LoS darkening stopped at the max dist, now hexes beyond the max dist are
    darkened
+ Bug: LoS highlighting/darkening computes LoSEffects in order to work, before
    these were computed outside of the max dist check, which could lead to
    wasted computation.  Now it is done within the max dist check.
+ Bug: LoS highlighting never considered spotlights for night fighting.  Now,
    if there is a unit that is illuminated in a hex, it will take that into
    account.
+ Bug: MechSummaryCache was storing BattleArmor tonnage as individual trooper
    weight, which is different from the unit table in the ChatLounge (where it
    is displayed as 1 ton per trooper).  The 1 on per trooper is what is
    important for transportation reasons, so I've changed MechSummaryCache to
    be consistent with the unit table in the ChatLounge.

v0.37.5-exp (2014-01-26 16:55 UTC)
+ Bug: Infantry and BattleArmor didn't have a jump button

v0.37.5 (2014-01-26 16:55 UTC)
+ Feature: BattleArmor equipment now tracks which location on the BA suit it is
    mounted on.  This isn't completely necessary from a current rules
    standpoint, but is required to facilitate consistency in MML (we need to
    be able to save the location a user assigns a weapon to).  Mounted used to
    only track if the weapon was body mounted, now it has a state variable
    baMountLoc, and BattleArmor defines 4 possible locations: NONE, BODY, LARM,
    RARM.  Additionally, the :DWP tag can be used in conjunction with a
    location tag (before only one tag was possible).
+ Added construction data for "machina domini" interface cockpit and gyro none
+ Added construction data for a few support vehicle engine types and chassis
    modifications
+ Added construction data for BattleMech Neural Interface Unit
+ Feature: Updated BLKFile to write out modifiers to Mounted so BattleArmor can
    load properly
+ Bug: Aeros, MUL, Reinforce and Bombs not working right still
+ Bug: TestAero would fail Aeros for mounted bombs, this has been fixed (for
    real this time)
+ Data: Some BA with new location tags.
+ Data: More BA Changes with new tags.
+ Added TSEMP modifier for steam engines
+ Data: Last of the new BA changes. They will need to be looked at in MM for
    errors.
+ Data: Unit fixes.
+ Bug [#3990]: Jumping Vehicles roll on the motive crit table but it's not
    clear why
+ Feature/Data: Battle armor equipment and some fixed units. Some of the data
    still needs to be checked and corrected. Some fixed units included.
+ Bug [#3988]: Fixes to Server for BA reflective/reactive armor
+ Bug: Cougar-XR was missing a jump jet in each leg
+ Bug [#3997]: PSR Needs 2, Rolls 2, Failed.
+ Bug: Potential NPE in TilesetManager
+ Data: More BA equipment and weapons (Compact NARC breaks MML).
+ Bug [#4001]: Arty Icons and SpecialHexDisplay
+ Bug: Fixed potential NPE in Los highlighting/darkening code
+ Refactored BoardView1.getToolTipText to use a StringBuffer
+ Bug [#4002]: BoardView1 Hex tooltip doesn't contain SpecialHexDisplay info
+ Data: New Images - Thanks SteveRestless.

+ Feature: Updated TestAero to properly account for the space taken up by XXL
    engines
+ Bug [#3991]: Dagger DAR4-XP armor type
+ Updated MechFileParser so that only one instance of Start/Stop Swarm,
    Leg Attack, etc get added to BA
+ Bug: BA Clan Reactive/Reflective armor had some data errors (internal names
    were set improperly)
+ Bug: TechConstants.isLegal didn't consider T_ALL_IS and T_ALL_CLAN for
    equipmentTechLvl
+ Bug [#4005]: VTOL Turrets always show target out of Arc
+ Bug: Mounted.baMountLocation was being initialized as
    BattleArmor.MOUNT_LOC_BODY instead of BattleArmor.MOUNT_LOC_NONE, which was
    causing the :Body tag to get added to all Mounteds that were saved to BLK
    files.
+ Added support for keeping track of the number of shots per crit for BA ammo
+ BLKFile now encodes a :ShotN#  string for BA Ammo, where N is the number of
    shots in the crit
+ BLKBattleArmor now parses the :ShotN# string to set the shots per crit
+ TestBattleArmor now accounts for ammo weight based on KG per shot
+ Bug: MunitionMutator didn't properly handle mutating BA ammo
+ Bug [#3420]: Pilots from MekHQ w/o Artillery skill do not import properly
+ Bug [#3960]: Player Disconnected, Could Not Reconnect.
+ Bug [#4000]: Default Icon for Ultra Light and Super Heavy Mechs
+ Bug [#3976]: Aerospace Launch/Recovery Bugs
+ Data: New Camo Pack - Thanks to SeaVea
+ Construction data ONLY for Naval Mass Drivers (need to be coded to work as a
    weapon)
+ Unit file Fixes.
+ Fixed protomech AC AP crit modifiers per a recent ruling on the rules question
   forum (http://bg.battletech.com/forums/index.php/topic,34101.msg800042.html)
+ Feature: With the addition of more camos in MM, it the camo dialog has become
    painful to use.  I changed the dropdown for category selection to a
    JTreeView.
+ Bug [#3966]: Tripod cockpit BV modifier
+ Fixed MechDisplay not changing the displayed location in the systems tab
   when used from MekWars
+ Bug: displacement was not setting elevation when displacement did not result
   in a fall, which resulted in lost buoyancy PSR fails when pushing into water
+ Fixed newlines in breach message
+ Bug: CamoChoiceDialog not working when no subfolders exist in camo folder

v0.37.4-exp (2014-01-12 02:20)
+ Feature: increased the expressiveness of the skin specifications.  Previously,
    edges had a single tiled icon.  Now, edges can have an arbitrary combination
    of static and tiled icons.

v0.37.4 (2014-01-12 02:20)
+ Data: Unit Fixes
+ Data: Start of FM:3145 RAT's (Mechs only)
+ Bug [#3977]: Unable to load MUL files created in versions prior to 0.37.3
+ Modified the ammo selection logic for Princess because I miss-understood the
    way incendiary ammo works and to take into account fire-resistant armor.
+ Bug: TESMP shutdown effect on tanks didn't last as long as it should
+ Bug: Tanks don't report when they automatically startup in the end phase
+ Added code to reduce the utility of firing on ejected mechwarriors/crews by
    1000. This should make Princess much less likely to fire on them.
+ Bug: /localLoad not working
+ Bug [#3981]: NPE in WeaponAttackAction.toHit with Apollo and ArtV
+ Bug: TSEMP shutdown effect on BA caused NPE
+ Bug [#3921]: charges and DFAs not working
+ Bug [#3973]: Partial Wings aren't dissipating heat (37.2 exp)
+ Bug: Mechs with Laser heatsinks and RHS have incorrect heat capacity
+ Bug [#3982]: TSEMP should cause interference to firing unit even on miss
+ BA had special armor types separate from the armor types for every other unit.
    This makes some of the code difficult to work with.  I have consolidated
    the BA armor into the armor for the rest of the units.  This required
    updating a few methods in EquipmentType.
+ Feature: Updated BattleArmor.setArmorType to handle setting state for special
    armor types, like stealth
+ Feature: BattleArmor BLK files can now specify armor_type and armor_tech
    tags which will be read in and written out
+ Added a BAArmor enum to TestBattleArmor.  This works like the AeroArmor enum
    in TestAero and is used to define what subset of all armors are legal for
    BattleArmor.
+ Feature: Implemented BA Reactive and Reflective armor
+ Added a new armor types, T_ARMOR_BA_REACTIVE and T_ARMOR_BA_REFLECTIVE along
    with MiscType creation methods for both types.  This is necessary as the
    tech lvls and intro dates differ from the 'mech version of the armor
+ EquipmentType and BattleArmor both had defines for BA armor names, they are
    now unified
+ Created a separate T_ARMOR_BA_STANDARD instead of sharing T_ARMOR_STANDARD
+ Added MiscTypes for separated Clan/IS BattleArmor Armors (Thanks to Hammer,
    who did most of the work)+
+ Correct some of the techlevel and dates for the MiscTypes
+ Bug: TestAero would fail Aeros for mounted bombs, this has been fixed
+ Bug: Updated methods getGoodCriticals, getBadCriticals, getDamagedCriticals,
    and getHitCriticals to work with mounteds due to EQUIPMENT_TYPE critical
    slots no longer having indexes
+ Data: Unit fixes and first batch of BA with new Armor Type and Tech Tags
+ Bug [#3985]: Bombs cannot be loaded via MUL files
    This fix involved adding 2 new methods to BombType:
    public static int getBombTypeFromName(String name) and
    public static int getBombTypeFromInternalName(String name)
+ Bug: Methods in Entity updated 2 commits ago still not quite right,
    re-written for clarity & damageSystem() also re-written to work correctly
    with TYPE_EQUIPMENT
+ Fix Stone's Brigades Filenames due to packaging errors

v0.37.3-exp (2014-01-07 02:54 UTC)
+ Bug: If there is no entity selected, FiringDisplay.setFiringSolutions can NPE
+ Bug: Fire keybind could make attacks that were invalid
+ Feature: When using ESC to clear chat message it now also slides the box down
+ Bug: Up/Down arrows in ChatterBox didn't appear to work properly
+ Bug: BoardView was not properly acquiring focus when the ChatterBox was
    activated, which could lead to key presses not being consumed by the CB
+ Feature: Added TOGGLE_CHAT_CMD keybind, which when used activates the
    ChatterBox and enters the command character (/)

v0.37.3 (2014-01-07 02:54 UTC)
+ Bug [#3970] Princess causes an NPE when determining a FiringPlan with no valid
    targets
+ Data: Unit Fixes
+ Bug: Fixed a few instances were CriticalSlot.getIndex() was causing NPEs
+ Bug: Updated Entity.isTargetable() to return false if position == null, to
    prevent some exceptions in the firing solution code
+ Feature: Added black borders around text in firing solutions, for readability
+ Feature: Enabled firing solutions for offboard phase (firing tags and such)
+ Bug [#3862]: Nighttime Movement Penalty Applies to Airborne VTOLS?
+ Errata: homing artillery now always targets an area, not a mapsheet
+ Bug [#3971]: More Clan LB-X submunition trouble
+ Bug: Princess.getEntityToMove() wasn't considering whether the Entity chose
    was valid for the current turn, which could lead to the Princess hanging
    during the movement phase in some situations (with no Exceptions thrown)
+ Feature: Implemented TSEMP
+ Feature: Added status effects to the MechDisplay Misc tab for TSEMP
+ Feature: Implemented radical heat sinks
+ Bug: NPE for Gun Emplacements related to Server.java creating a TestTank
    in receiveEntityAdd
+ RFE [#1210]: Implement Crew-size Benefits/Penalties
+ Added some new methods to Compute.java for calculating Crew size and made
    it so that entities now set their crew size correctly
+ Added another crew calculation method that I missed
+ Optionized RFE 1210 and added the malus/restrictions for single crew vehicles
+ Adjusted how TSEMP hits are processed.  Now they happen when the weapon is
    fired instead or all being processed at the end of the firing phase.
    This makes the reports look nicer.

v0.37.2-exp (2014-01-01 17:50 UTC)
+ Feature: Allowing UI components to be customized (skins)
+ Bug: readme path was wrong in MegamekGUI
+ Bug: Exception when saving client options with a tooltip dismiss delay <0
+ Feature: Added a skinning help menu item and a corresponding help file
+ Bug [#3917]: UMU button causes issues for Battlearmor moving underwater
+ Feature: Changed the typing behavior of ChatterBox2 - now it only consumes
    keypresses when it's 'active' and can be activated by pressing enter,
    both escape and enter will deactive text entry with escape clearing the
    text and enter sending the text.  Clicking on the cb2 and clicking on the
    board view active and deactive text entry respectively.
+ Feature: Added WASD based scrolling for the board view.  This is implemented
    with timers and is considerably smoother than previous keyboard scrolling
+ Initiated a rewrite of the whole key handling framework in MegaMek.
    Previously, we were using KeyListeners scattered throughout the project and
    this caused issues, particularly with the MechDisplay; when the MechDisplay
    has focus there are issues getting KeyEvents to the BoardView and current
    phase display panel.  Instead of having disparate KeyListeners, I created a
    new KeyDispatcher, called MegaMekController.  This KeyDispatcher gets
    registered with the KeyFocusManager and basically gets first crack at all
    of the KeyEvents, regardless of where they originate from.  The Dispatcher
    can choose to consume the event, or pass it along.  This allows a more
    central handler for key events regardless of focus.
+ Moved ChatterBox activation/deactivation into the new key handling framework
+ Converted MovementDisplay to use MegaMekController
+ Converted FiringDisplay to use MegaMekController
+ Converted TargetingDisplay to use MegaMekController
+ Added key binds for weapons firing and next weapon
+ Keybinds can now be specified in an xml file, defaultKeyBinds.xml has been
    created which follows the schema defined in keyBindingSchem.xsl
+ Added key binds for previous weapon/next weapon (Q/E)
+ Added key binds for previous target/next target (Shift-Q/Shift-E)
+ Added key binds for previous unit/next unit (Z/C)
+ Added 'Key Binds' panel to Client Settings dialog.  Keybinds can now be
    edited in game and will be saved to an xml file

v0.37.2 (2014-01-01 17:32 UTC)
+ Bug [#3957]: New (Unofficial) Case Rule Duplicated
+ Data: New (Unofficial) Against The Bot RATS (Currently Civilian Only)
+ Bug [#3962]: NPE in TripodMech.hasActiveShield when Tripod adjacent to
    building
+ Bug [#3958]: Re-Lasers versus Hardened Armor
+ Bug: BattleArmor couldn't fire at zero range
+ Bug: Disabling firing solutions wasn't working quite right
+ Data: Unit fixes/New Images
+ Bug: Restoring Commented out Clan Missile Ammunitions.
+ Bug: Call to CriticalSlot.getIndex can lead to an NPE in Server.CriticalEntity
+ Bug [#3965]: ABA armor incorrectly adding -2 modifier
+ Bug [#3972]: Princess Infinite /victory /defeat loop
+ Added crew size to the MUL file for use with MekHQ

v0.37.1 (2013-12-29, 19:26 UTC)
+ Added code to Princess to make (semi) intelligent use of ammo.  Previously she
    just picked whichever ammo bin was next on the list.  Now she will examine
    her target and try to pick the best ammo of what she has available (infernos
    vs hot targets, cluster/flak vs aero/vtol, cluster/inferno vs tanks, etc).
    She also takes into account range when using ATMs and MMLs.  Don't expect
    this to work with ammo introduced after the FCCW as I'm not familiar with it
    myself.
+ Data: Unit fixes and New Images
+ Tweak TestAero to allow for customization of Aeros in MHQ
+ Data: Unit fixes and image fixes
+ Data: Remaining RS 3145 Units and a couple of new images.
+ Bug: subMunitionLength for Clan LB10-X was improperly set, which could lead
    to a string index out of range exception
+ Bug: Infantry unable to use swarm/leg attacks, getting a "only infantry weapon
    can fire at 0 range" message
+ Bug: Firing small arms then trying to fire field guns would lead to a
    'infantry can't fire small arms and field guns in the same turn' message,
    however firing a field gun then small arms didn't receive this message
+ Bug: Improved Ferro-Aluminum, Ferro-Carbide, and Lamellor Ferro-Carbide armor
    multipliers incorrect I took a moment to re-work how the clan armors for
    these specialty types is worked as well, instead of using a special
    multiplier and multiple if statements for them I used a single if statement
    with an additive of 0.08 (clan multipler for FF anf FA is 1.2 vs. 1.12, and
    the rest of these are additions on top of that) to the I.S. multipler.
+ Data: Unit Fixes.
+ Adjusted the too many units loading message: added a specific message for
    infantry, so it makes more sense.  Also fixed a bug where instead of
    currentLoad/capcity being displayed it was displaying
    currentLoad/currentLoad.
+ Bug [#3963]: The check for adding the MagClamp loading option was using a
    different check than what is used to determine if mag clamps can be used.

v0.37.0 (2013-12-21, 13:13 UTC1+)
+ Bug: Fixed some issues with the path planner.  First, for the candidate list,
  I changed the ArrayList to a PriorityQueue.  There was also a bug where every
  256 iterations it would check to see if the current path was better than the
  currently saved best path and if it wasn't it would end.  This is an
  assumption that doesn't always hold and basically resulted in the A*
  path-planner halting prematurely.  If the A* path-planner didn't reach the
  goal, the path is finished with a straight-line planner.  Fixing this allows
  the A* planner to work for longer and hence find much better paths
  (although it's still has a maximu time limit).
+ Feature: Added engine name, gyro type and myomer name to MechSummary and set
  these values when the summaries are created
+ Added a tool to create a CSV of MechSummaries for all units in the data files,
  excluding infantry.  This was requested by Hammer for some MekHQ data work.
+ Bug [#3848]: ImageCache.get uses expensive operations
+ Patch: MaxTech Movement Modifiers & Unofficial MASC Options
+ Bug: The ImageCache max size check was using == instead of >=
+ Bug: MechSummary and AdvancedSearch were using EquipmentType.getName() instead
    of getInternalName()
+ Enabled the MechEditorDialog for post-stable branch
+ Removed ImageCache maximum size
+ Bug: Board.setHex - shouldn't adust min/max elev if they are undefined
+ Bug [#3618]:  Matched input/output stream buffers to socket receive/send
    buffer
+ Bug: When handling a COMMAND_ENTITY_ADD packet, the server was calling
    transmitAllPlayerDones twice, which was causing superfluous overhead
+ Bug [#3618]: Updates to the code for adding multiple entities, see SF bug
    ticket for details.  After these changes, adding 200 mechs in the chat
    lounge goes from ~65s to ~15s.
+ Bug [#3893]: ChatLounge 'Delete All' button is very slow.
+ Removed AWT and 3d interfaces, they were old and unmaintained

    able to.
+ Bug [#3949]: Cluster Hitter Pilot Ability Description Missing 0.37-dev

    Depending on situation, Princess should be 25% to 60% faster moving units.

    be seen by an enemy, but I'm not using double blind. Thoughts anyone?)
+ Bug [#3119]: Squadron Overheat Strat Ops errata
+ Bug : Several issues with the ChoiceDialog for launching fighters.  It has a
    nag if the bay doors are overloaded with launching fighters.  This nag
    message has the option to not ask again, but the answer to this isn't saved.
    Now it is.  Also, the nag is very specific about what kinds of rolls will
    need to be made for launching too many fighters.  Finally, there was an NPE
    if no units were selected and ok/cancel was clicked.  This made it
    impossible to launch latter bays without launching from previous bays,
     but it's fixed now.

+ Bug: Infantry bays show tons/ton instead of platoons/platoon
+ Refactored arlith's fix for loading too many units so that it doesn't NPE on
    non-bay units. He is going to continue to refactor it so that it'll actually
    be smarter, but for now it just needs to work.

    firing phase can lead to NPEs.
+ Bug: Ground bombing was allowed in space, space bombing was allowed in ground
    /atmosphere
+ Bug: FighterSquadron had a collection of Entity objects.  When server/client
    communication happens, these objects can get de-synched with the global
    collection of Entities in the client/server.  To prevent this, the
    collection was changed to Entity IDs
+ Bug [#3816]: Bombs cannot be used with fighter squadrons
+ Bug: Timestamp comparision backwards
+ Bug: Server.sendLoadGame() modification for XML saves only incorrect
+ Bug: transports added to an Entity don't have their game state variable set,
    which can lead to NPEs

+ Bug: Fixed a divide-by-zero in Game.getEntity if Game.entities is 0 (ie, the
    player is an observer)
+ Bug: Problems with unload(Entity) methods: transporters were changed to use
    entity Ids instead of Entity references.  Many of the unload methods were
    trying to remove an Entity object from a Vector<Integer> which caused
    problems
+ Bug: Improper clearing of minefields on game reset could lead to NPEs in
    subsequent games.

 To use this, Java 3d needs to be installed on your machine
 (https://java3d.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html) Then, run MegaMek with the
  commandline parameter
 -Dmegamek.client.ui.AWT.boardView=megamek.client.ui.AWT.boardview3d.BoardView3D
 Also, the memory allocated to MegaMek should be increased by using the command
 line parameter -Xmx256M, as soon as you want to play on somewhat larger maps.

+ Patch 1230249, Bugs 1224113, 1224451: Arrow IV homing targets mapsheet.
   The server tries to share out homing missiles fairly among TAGs fired
   at targets on the same mapsheet.
   TAG has a "mode" setting, allowing that TAG shot to take 1,2,3 or 4 shares
   of the incoming missiles. This allows the player some control over target
   priority (e.g. send 3 missiles at the Atlas and 1 at the Marksman).
   If there are more incoming missiles than the sum of the priorities, it
   starts over (so no need to mess with mode
   setting at all if you just want an even split).
   The "Rulebreaker" option "a4homing_target_area" uses 8 hex radius from the
   target hex instead of mapsheets for eligible targets.
+ TAG should not be able to target infantry.
+ Arrow IV homing misses still do 5 damage when they miss but the TAG hit.
+ Patch 1230251: IS Copperhead ammo for Sniper and Long Tom.
+ Bug 1228911: AmmoType and friends refactored to use a long flag for
    munition types.

+ Bug 1230607: C3 Masters should be able to TAG.
+ Bug 1042069: Allow Fusion Vehicles that have Vacuum Protection to survive in
    vacuum. To add Vacuum Protection to a unit, give it an equipment named
    "Vacuum Protection".
+ Bug 1174457: after /reset minefield's wouldn't work.
+ more cost fixing goodness.
+ Bug 1194504: Added "done" marker to right-click and pop-up window on
    BoardView1, to make it easier to determine if something has moved.
+ Allow autoeject setting in Scenario files.
+ Minor change to IEntityMovementType for future work on submarines.
+ AmmoType refactoring broke LBX ACs.
+ Code for parsing autoeject setting wasn't compatible with pre-1.5 Java

+ Created new /logs directory and moved appropriate files there.  Also
    renamed MegaMek.log to megameklog.txt for ease of use.
+ Bug 1230913: Old techbase bugfix for HMPRead not committed until now.
+ Added OfficialUnitList.txt--massaged version of an official unit list,
    with name of each official unit, who uses it, type, date of manufacture.
    Should make for easy official unit checking/time period restriction/etc.
+ Patch 1231268: AC incendiary and tracer ammo.
+ Bug 1231362: Verification of custom TDB meks not working
+ Fixed build.xml to create the logdir if neccessary
+ Build.bat should be working again.
+ Obsolete TODO in EntityListFile.java was only valid when we created an EXE;
    produce XML files in UTF-8 format.
+ Added TODOs to handle slotless equipment and tank crits.
+ "Canon units only" option added--doesn't work 100% of the time, bunches of
    our unit names (like all infantry) are wrong, according to my master list.
