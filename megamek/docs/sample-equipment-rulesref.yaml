# Sample Equipment Definition with Structured Rules References
# This file demonstrates the new rulesRefs format for equipment definitions.
#
# The rulesRefs field now supports a structured format with:
#   - page: The page number or range (e.g., "205" or "204-206")
#   - book: The book abbreviation (e.g., "TM", "TO: AU&E")
#   - text: (Optional) The actual rules text for quick reference
#
# The system also maintains backward compatibility with the legacy format:
#   rulesRefs: "205, TM"

version: "1.0"

# Example 1: Medium Laser with single rules reference
id: ISMediumLaser
name: Medium Laser
shortName: Med Laser
rulesRefs:
  - page: "227"
    book: "TM"

# Example 2: Equipment with multiple rules references
id: CLERMediumLaser
name: ER Medium Laser
shortName: ER Med Laser
rulesRefs:
  - page: "226"
    book: "TM"
  - page: "96"
    book: "TO: AU&E"

# Example 3: Equipment with rules text included
id: CLTargetingComputer
name: Targeting Computer
shortName: TC
rulesRefs:
  - page: "238"
    book: "TM"
    text: >
      A targeting computer (TC) is a specialized computer that interfaces
      directly with a unit's weapons systems. When a TC is installed, it
      provides a -1 modifier to the to-hit number for all direct-fire
      ballistic and energy weapons linked to it.

# Example 4: Equipment with page range
id: ISStreakSRM6
name: Streak SRM 6
shortName: SSRM 6
rulesRefs:
  - page: "229-230"
    book: "TM"
  - page: "105"
    book: "TO: AU&E"
    text: >
      Streak SRM launchers only fire when a target lock is achieved.
      If the lock fails, no ammunition is expended.

# Legacy format (still supported for backward compatibility)
# id: ISMediumLaser
# name: Medium Laser
# rulesRefs: "227, TM"

# Multiple refs in legacy format
# rulesRefs: "227, TM; 96, TO: AU&E"
