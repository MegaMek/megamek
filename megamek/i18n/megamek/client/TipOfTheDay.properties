tip.1=Right-click on almost anything (units, buttons, map hexes) to see a context menu with available actions.
tip.2=Don't forget about physical attacks! Kicks, punches, and charges can be very effective, especially when ammo runs low or heat is high.
tip.3=Heat management is crucial. Firing too many weapons can lead to shutdowns or ammo explosions. Use the Heat Dial to plan your actions.
tip.4=Terrain matters! Woods provide cover, water helps dissipate heat, and elevation affects line of sight.
tip.5=Indirect fire (LRMs) can be powerful but requires a spotter with line of sight to the target.
tip.6=Running increases your movement distance but also makes your 'Mech a harder target *and* makes it harder for you to hit enemies.
tip.7=You can press "T" to switch between top view and isometric view.
