/**
 * Package containing classes for calculating axis values for the CASPAR bot.
 * These classes are used to evaluate the current game state and provide information to the bot neural network model
 * for decision-making.
 * Any significant changes here must be replicated in the training software, and the training software must be run to
 * update the model.
 * Changes to the training software on the feature extraction also need to be replicated in the bot.
 * The training software is located in the https://github.com/MegaMek/mm-caspar-trainer repository.
