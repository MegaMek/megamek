 * Calculates the median coordinate of enemy units for tactical decision-making.

 * <p>
 * The calculation:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Filters out enemies without valid positions</li>
 *   <li>Sorts enemies by distance, with adjustments for units that haven't moved</li>
 *   <li>Considers only the closest enemies (limited to a small tactical group)</li>
 *   <li>Calculates the geometric median of these positions</li>
 * </ul>
