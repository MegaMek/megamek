/**
 * This represents a report for any typical MegaMek suite calculation such as BV, cost or AS conversion.
 * It assumes that each line will have at most three entries, a sort of header text ("Damage:"), a calculation
 * ("5 + 5 + 7 * 0.2") and a result on the right side ("11.4").
 *
 * The result can be given as a String or as a double value with a prefix String. When a double value is
 * given, it will be rounded to one decimal digit. Since the second entry (the calculation text) can
 * be more complicated than a single number, it can only be passed as a String and rounding must be
 * performed by the caller if needed.
