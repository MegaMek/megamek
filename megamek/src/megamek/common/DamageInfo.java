/**
 * Record class for passing damage application information to a Damage Manager's damageEntity() method.
 * <p>
 * This moves a lot of boilerplate and chained function call responsibility out of TWGameManager in preparation for
 * replacing those overloaded functions with a single function, and having callers instantiate DamageInfo
 *
 * @param entity        the target entity that will suffer damage
 * @param hit           the hit data for the location hit
 * @param damage        the amount of damage to apply
 * @param ammoExplosion ammo explosion type damage is applied directly to the IS, hurts the pilot, causes auto-ejects,
 *                      and can blow the unit to smithereens
 * @param damageType    The DamageType of the attack (mostly used by specialty armor handling).
 * @param damageIS      Should the target location's internal structure be damaged directly?
 * @param areaSatArty   Is the damage from an area saturating artillery attack / AE damage?
 * @param throughFront  Is the damage coming through the hex the unit is facing?  For Cowl, etc.
 * @param underWater    Is the damage coming from an underwater attack?
 * @param nukeS2S       is this a ship-to-ship nuke?
