/**
 * Contains data used by crew to determine how many distinct crew members to track for name, damage, and skills, and
 * which crew normally execute which roles. Note that this applies to various special multi-crew cockpits in which crew
 * members can take over duties of another that has been incapacitated; units with multiple crew that do not track them
 * separately (such as vehicles and aerospace vessels) still use the SINGLE value, since they do not track damage to
 * individual crew members (outside specific criticalSlots) and only have a single set of skills.
