/**
 * This is a local MegaMek version of java.io.File and is designed to support
 * having files that could exist in two locations: the MM install location and
 * a userdata directory. When a file is opened, the path is first checked to
 * see if it exists within the userdata directory, and if it does, that file is
 * opened. However, if it doesn't exist, then the file is opened from MM's
 * install directory instead.
