/**
 * A comparator that compares the inputs based on natural sort order.
 *
 * Natural sort order is an easier to parse format that counts multi-digit numbers atomically (as a
 * single number)
 *
 * Windows File Explorer uses this format for files as it is more human-friendly, but
 * ASCII sort order is more common in computer programs because of the ease of programming in that
 * order.
 *
 * To showcase how this works, below is an example:
 * The list of Strings { "Atlas 0", "Atlas 15", "Atlas 2", "Atlas 1", "Atlas 5" }
 * would be sorted into { "Atlas 0", "Atlas 1", "Atlas 2", "Atlas 5", "Atlas 15" }
 * instead of ASCII's { "Atlas 0", "Atlas 1", "Atlas 15", "Atlas 2", "Atlas 5" }
