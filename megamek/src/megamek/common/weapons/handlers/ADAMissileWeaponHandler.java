 *       This class extends MissleWeaponHandler to ensure that Air-Defense Arrow IV missiles, which act differently from
 *       most other missiles, are handled correctly.
 *       <p>
 *       Specifically, ADA Missiles do a single hit of 20 damage to 1 location without AE damage and without rolling on
 *       the cluster table.
