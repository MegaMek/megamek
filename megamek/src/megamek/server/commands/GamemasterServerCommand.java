/**
 * A ServerCommand that can only be used by Game Masters, This abstract class implements many features that are common
 * to all Game Master commands, like the isGM check for users, it also uses the Argument class for building the command
 * arguments and to abstract the parsing of the arguments, limit assertion and error handling, and for building a more
 * dynamic "help" feature. It also has a more advanced parser and argument handling than the ServerCommand class, which
 * allows for named arguments, positional arguments, optional arguments and default values. named arguments can be
 * passed in any order, and positional arguments are parsed in order and MUST appear before named arguments.
