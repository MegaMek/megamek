/**
 * This class represents events that can be added programmatically or from MM scenarios to check for game end. When the
 * game ends and no victory conditions are met, the game is a draw. Note: The Trigger must *not* be a one-time trigger.
 *
 * <P>Some examples for game end triggers:</P>
 * <P>To end the game after the 10th round:</P>
 * <P><code>game.addScriptedEvent(new GameEndTriggeredEvent(new SpecificRoundEndTrigger(10)));</code></P>
 * <P>To end the game after after the unit with ID 102 has been killed:</P>
 * <P><code>game.addScriptedEvent(new GameEndTriggeredEvent(new UnitKilledTrigger(102)));</code></P>
 * <P>To end the game after after the units with IDs 10 and 18 have both fled:</P>
 * <P><code>game.addScriptedEvent(new GameEndTriggeredEvent(new FledUnitsTrigger(null, 2, List.of(10,
 * 18))));</code></P>
 *
 * <P>Adding multiple conditions to the game is equivalent to OR-ing them. Conditions can be ANDed or NOTed
 * as well using the AndTrigger and NotTrigger:</P>
 * <P><code>game.addScriptedEvent(new GameEndTriggeredEvent(
 * new AndTrigger( new UnitKilledTrigger(2), new FledUnitsTrigger(null, 1))));</code></P>
 *
 * @param trigger The trigger that decides if victory has occurred
 *
 * @see TriggeredEvent
 * @see AndTrigger
 * @see FledUnitsTrigger
 * @see ActiveUnitsTrigger
