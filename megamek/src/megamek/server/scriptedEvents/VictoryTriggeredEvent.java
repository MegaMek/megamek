/**
 * This class represents victory events that can be added programmatically or from MM scenarios to check for victory of
 * a team. There are two ways these victory events can be used, depending on the isGameEnding parameter: When
 * isGameEnding is true, this victory condition is checked at the end of game rounds and if it is met, the game ends.
 * When isGameEnding is false, this victory condition is only checked after the game has already ended through another
 * condition (round limit or other event).
 * <p>
 * Note: Victory Triggers must *not* be one-time triggers. Victory is checked multiple times, even when victory is
 * achieved and triggers must be able to react multiple times.
 *
 * @param trigger    The trigger that decides if victory has occurred
 * @param endsGame   When true, ends the game when it happens, when false, is only checked when the game has ended
 * @param playerName The name of the player who wins by this triggered event
 *
 * @see GameEndTriggeredEvent
 * @see DrawTriggeredEvent
