/**
 * This class represents victory events that can be added programmatically or from MM scenarios to check for victory of a team. There are
 * two ways these victory events can be used, depending on the isGameEnding parameter: When isGameEnding is true, this victory condition is
 * checked at the end of game rounds and if it is met, the game ends. When isGameEnding is false, this victory condition is only checked
 * after the game has already ended through another condition (round limit or other event).
 *
 * Note: Victory Triggers must *not* be one-time triggers. Victory is checked multiple times, even when victory is achieved and triggers
 * must be able to react multiple times.
 *
 * @param trigger    The trigger that decides if victory has occurred
 * @param endsGame   When true, ends the game when it happens, when false, is only checked when the game has ended
 * @param playerName The name of the player who wins by this triggered event
 * @see GameEndTriggeredEvent
 * @see DrawTriggeredEvent
