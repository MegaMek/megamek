/**
 * Interface for classes judging whether a victory occurred or not. These
 * classes may not modify game state. Reporting must be done via the given
 * interface. classes also should not have any nasty internal state outside
 * methods this will guarantee them to act _only_ based on gamestate The only
 * case where this should be done is in cases where you have to count occurances
 * of some action or duration of something. In this case the information should
 * be stored in the context-object NOTE: if you delegate from one victory-class
 * instance to other, they must be created in similar fashion (ie. constructed
 * at the same time and destroyed at the same time) to guarantee proper working
 * also, if you delegate, you should delegate each time to guarantee that
 * victorypoint-counting and duration-counting implementations get access to
 * game state every round. NOTE2: calling victory 1 time or n times per round
 * should not make a difference! victories counting rounds must not assume that
 * they are called only once per round NOTE3: dont even think about making
 * different victoryclasses communicate straight or via context-object ;) NOTE4:
 * victories should take into account in their reporting (adding reports to the
 * result-object) that their results might be filtered. So the reports should be
 * mostly of the "what is the score" -type (player A occupies the victory
 * location) or fact-type (Player A has destroyed player B's commander)
