 * Interface for classes judging whether a victory occurred or not. These classes must not modify
 * the game state. Reporting must be done via the given interface.
 * <BR>
 * Note: VictoryConditions may be checked any number of times at various points in the game and
 * implementing classes must be able to deal with this. For example, a VictoryCondition that counts
 * rounds must not assume that is is called only once per round.
 * <BR>
 * Note: VictoryConditions should add proper reports to their resulting VictoryResult. When doing so,
 * note that their results might be filtered in double-blind games. So, the reports should be
 * mostly of the "what is the score"-type (player A occupies the victory location) or fact-type
 * (Player A has destroyed player B's commander).
 * <BR>
 * Note: The context should use simple serializable objects (preferably Integers, Strings, Doubles etc.)
 * to store state between executions if such a feature is absolutely required.
