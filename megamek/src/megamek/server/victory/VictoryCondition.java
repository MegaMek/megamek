 * Interface for classes judging whether a victory occurred or not. These classes must not modify the game state.

 * Note: VictoryConditions may be checked any number of times at various points in the game and implementing classes
 * must be able to deal with this. For example, a VictoryCondition that counts rounds must not assume that is called
 * only once per round.
 * <BR>
 * Note: VictoryConditions should add proper reports to their resulting VictoryResult. When doing so, note that their
 * results might be filtered in double-blind games. So, the reports should be mostly of the "what is the score"-type
 * (player A occupies the victory location) or fact-type (Player A has destroyed player B's commander).
 * <BR>
 * Note: The context should use simple serializable objects (preferably Integers, Strings, Doubles etc.) to store state
 * between executions if such a feature is absolutely required.
