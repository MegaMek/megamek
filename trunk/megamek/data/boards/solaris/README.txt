Special Instructions:

 The Ishiyama set is made up of 49 boards of size 10x10. These are modular and
 are intended to be arranged randomly (by using the Surprise option). The
 recommended game size is 3x3 to 5x5 boards depending on the number and type
 of mechs. If playing with Double Blind rules (highly recommended!) it's best
 not to go beyond 4x4 boards.

 The Colosseum set is made up of 20 boards, representing a variety of different
 arrangements for the various moving parts (these are fixed for each board
 because MM doesn't -yet- support dynamic terrain features). Just pick one at
 random.
