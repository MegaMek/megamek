# Notes on adaptation:                                                      #
# * The original Xotl tables use a d1,000 to randomly determine the unit.   #
#   For the adaptation I simply use the frequency of the entry as the       #
#   MegaMek RAT Weight value.  So, a unit that appears on rolls 101-200     #
#   receives a base Weight of 100.                                          #
# * The original Xotl tables include a chance for a faction to field the    #
#   units of another faction. Unfortunately, MegaMek will not recognize a   #
#   call to a different RAT file.  In order to facilitate this              #
#   functionality, I include the salvaged/isorla faction's mechs.  However, #
#   in oder to preserve unit ratios as much as possible, I weight the main  #
#   faction's list higher.  In general, the faction allocations values 1-50 #
#   as salvage.  This is 5% of the available possibilities.  If a faction   #
#   salvages from 2 other lists, they tend to be split evenly (25 entries   #
#   each or 2.5%).  So, in this case, I multiply salvage faction's weights  #
#   by the approrpiate percentage and add them to the main faction list.  I #
#   then multiply all the weights by 10 (rounding to the nearest integer)   #
#   to turn the table into a d10,000 roll and drop any weights that end up  #
#   less than 1.                                                            #
