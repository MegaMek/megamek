This is a guide to the bot that comes with MegaMek 0.25.  The bot was written
by Michael Hanson <hanson@cs.stanford.edu>.  It is very much a work in progress.

Please do not email the authors about problems with the bot.  Posting in forums
is fine, but the authors do not wish to be contacted directly about it.  Any
email about the bot will be ignored.

  Starting A Game Against The Bot
    To play against the bot, host a game, and then start another copy of MegaMek
    and press the "Connect as Bot..." button in the main menu.  Connect as 
    though you were playing a hotseat game (see the readme for details.)  You
    will need to pick mechs and a starting position for the bot and press ready
    when you are ready to start the game.  Starting with the initiative screen,
    the bot will begin to play.  You can play your side, but do not press any
    buttons for the bot.

  Bot Vs. Bot!
    Because the bot connects like a normal client, you can connect two seperate
    bots and they will fight against each other.  (Be sure that they can see
    each other to start with though, or nothing may happen, see below.)  If you
    do not want to play, you can start a dedicated server (see the readme) and
    connect two bots to it.

  Tips
    o Try to use mechs with less than 4/6 movement.  Because of the way the bot
      decides its movement, it will take a long time in the movement phase if
      you use mechs with higher movement.
    o The bot will not move unless it is threatened or it has a target that
      turn.  This means that you will usually have to move into weapon range 
      and LOS before you will see any response from it.
