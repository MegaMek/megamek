  
CODE IDEAS:
-----------
- new map format to support all sorts of wacky terrain 
- don't have the image file name set with the terrain

could almost be combined:
- boardlisteners listen to boardview, not board
- seperate client and gui, allowing for other guis

- clean up report generation in Server.java

- improve code readibility, commenting; break up 80+ character lines, etc.
- make fields private, classes encapsulated

? javax.swing gui

- the turn report could keep a list of "message" objects 
  instead of a large report string.  This would allow some customizing of the
  display, or even translation (vieleicht zum Deutcher sprache.)
- more server validation of client data
  

RULES/DISPLAY STUFF TO DO, OR AT LEAST TO CONSIDER:
---------------------------------------------------
general:
- double reports when firing phase happens and physical phase is skipped
- in the lobby, perhaps the mech name could be hidden and only show the BV

board display:
? display something in exchange phase
? show dead mechs as rubble?
? some way to resize chat to be bigger or smaller
- nice to be able to see other mech's stats while waiting (or firing, or whatever)
- zooming

mech display:
- extra heat capacity due to underwater heat sinks doesn't show up

mechs:
- allow split criticals for large weapons in MEP files (or in general)
- any more .mep parsing problems?
- parse XML files (from BTTC, even)

initiative:
? ineligible units should maybe count in the action queue, but be skipped
- possibly stagger within packs
? might show whole initiative sequence somewhere

movement:
? mech can try moving again if failed getting up
- jump jets above water should work when jumping out of water
- pavement movement and skidding
- go prone action
- jump into level 1 water should need roll (bdee)

weapon attacks:
- "intervening" routine needs to be able to handle both sides of hex line
? option to step thru roll by roll
- eliminate leg weapons & kicks in level 1 water under level 1 rules

physical attacks:
- dfa should violate stacking
- opposing pushes should counter each other

displacement issues:
- hide under the desk
- cry
- domino effect: mechs with movement available can roll to step out of the way

pilots:
- successive consciousness checks should be made from low rolls to high

falling:
- only fall to surface of water


FUTURE VERSION PLANS:
---------------------
- any remaining level 1 rules without bugs
- level 2!
- more interface improvements, particularly in the lobby

v 0.26
- revise map code to support more terrain & terrain effects
- also on map code, use a tileset, no more image names in map files
