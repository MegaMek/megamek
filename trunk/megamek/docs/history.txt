+ Patch 997507: Reworked how scrolling works, including a Drag-and-Drop right-
    click scroll option, like it is used in lots of other games. The default

    also in the firing phase, this was made possible because now we don't get a

    also made the 'always scroll using right click' option obsolete. Shift 
    scrolling works the same as before, but it can't be used exclusively anymore.
    To use the new Drag-and-Drop right-click scrolling option, activate the

    Mouse.

v 0.29.2 (06-07-03, 12am)
+ Task L3 Advantages: Added core code for L3 (MaxTech) pilot advantages. To 
  enable these you must enable the MaxTech pilot advantages Game Option. This 
  will make a scrollable box visible in the customize mech dialog. Advantages
  finished are: Dodge Maneuver, Maneuvering Ace, Melee Specialist and 
  Pain Resistance
+ Task L3 Engine Explosions: Engine explosions, per MaxTech (BTH12 after 2 or 
  more engine crits in a round), are done.
+ Task L3 Scenario Improvements: Added ability to define pilot advantages for a
  scenario. See new Example.mms
+ File Added: data/scenarios/Example.mms to explain all scenario posibilities
+ Task L3 Weight Class Mods: MaxTech 20+ damage per round weight class mods 
  added. Assaults are -2 to BTH, whereas lights are +1. Mediums and heavies are
  in between. When turned on, also enables cumulative damage tracking. Roll is
  now +1 for EVERY 20 damage taken in a round instead of just for the first 20. 
  It's still only 1 pilot roll for the damage. Therefore, 20-39 damage is +1, 
  40-59 is +2, etc...

  piloting skill rolls.
+ Bug 763169: Dropping prone now has chance to dislodge swarmers.

+ Found and fixed bug in L3 weight mod damage rolls. Was forcing 2 pilot rolls.
+ Added ability to save game options. On the Game options dialog is a save 
  button which will write the current state of the game options to the
  gameoptions.xml file. This file is read at start up if you are hosting a game
  and will automatically set your desired 'default' options.
+ Task L3 Firing while down: MaxTech firing while down rule: can fire if you 
  still have one arm but are at a +1 to hit with all weapons and can not
  fire weapons in that arm.
+ Task L3 Opposed weight mods for physicals: PSR BTH when being kicked or 
  pushed is modified by weight class difference. Modifier is 1 for every 
  weight class difference. Add the difference to the PSR BTH if the attacker
  is heavier, subtract if the attacker is lighter.
+ Extracted multiple version of status bar code to one StatusBarPhaseDisplay 
  class and changed all phase display subclasses to extend this. This allows 
  changes to the status bar to happen in one and only one place.
+ Added save/load of advantages for unit list
